OBJECTIVE	The study evaluated the effectiveness of a three-year outpatient commitment pilot program established in @ at Bellevue Hospital in New York City .
METHODS	A total of @ participants were randomly assigned ; @ received court-ordered treatment , which included enhanced services , and @ received the enhanced-service package only .
METHODS	Between @ and @ percent of the subjects completed interviews at one , five , and @ months after hospital discharge .
METHODS	Outcome measures included rehospitalization , arrest , quality of life , symptomatology , treatment noncompliance , and perceived level of coercion .
RESULTS	On all major outcome measures , no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups .
RESULTS	No subject was arrested for a violent crime .
RESULTS	Eighteen percent of the court-ordered group and @ percent of the control group were arrested at least once .
RESULTS	The percentage rehospitalized during follow-up was about the same for both groups-@ percent and @ percent , respectively .
RESULTS	The groups did not differ significantly in the total number of days hospitalized during the follow-up period .
RESULTS	Participants ' perceptions of their quality of life and level of coercion were about the same .
RESULTS	From the community service providers ' perspective , patients in the two groups were similarly adherent to their required treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	All results must be qualified by the fact that no pick-up order procedures for noncompliant subjects in the court-ordered group were implemented during the study , which compromised the differences between the conditions for the two groups , and that persons with a history of violence were excluded from the program .
