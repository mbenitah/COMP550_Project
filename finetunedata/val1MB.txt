RESULTS	Improvements in P@NP were associated with @-week decreases in PCDAI ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	CTX-@ and DPD also increased during induction ( P < @ and P = @ , respectively ) but were not associated with changes in PCDAI .
RESULTS	Changes in CTX-@ were associated with improvements in height z-score ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Infliximab therapy is associated with dramatic increases in BSAP and P@NP , consistent with inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha effects on osteoblasts .
CONCLUSIONS	The increases in CTX-@ and DPD likely reflect coupling of bone formation and resorption and increases in linear growth .

OBJECTIVE	This study was done to assess and compare the prognostic significance of multiple methods for measuring ST-segment elevation resolution ( STR ) following primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
BACKGROUND	Resolution of ST-segment elevation ( STE ) is a powerful predictor of both infarct-related artery patency and mortality in acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .
BACKGROUND	Recent thrombolytic studies have suggested that simple measures of STR may be as powerful as more complex algorithms .
BACKGROUND	The optimal method of assessing STR following primary PCI has not been studied .
METHODS	We analyzed @ patients with technically adequate baseline and post-PCI electrocardiograms from the Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications ( CADILLAC ) trial .
METHODS	Five methods were used to assess STR : @ ) summed % STR across multiple leads ( SigmaSTR ) ; @ ) % STR in the single lead with maximum baseline STE ( MaxSTR ) ; @ ) absolute maximum STE before the procedure ; @ ) absolute maximum STE after intervention ( MaxSTPost ) ; and @ ) a categorical variable based upon MaxSTPost ( High Risk ) .
RESULTS	At @ days , SigmaSTR , MaxSTR , and MaxSTPost all correlated strongly with mortality ( p = @ , p = @ , and p < @ , respectively ) and the combined end point of mortality or reinfarction ( p = @ , p = @ , and p < @ ) .
RESULTS	At one year , SigmaSTR and MaxSTPost correlated with mortality ( p = @ , p = @ ) , reinfarction ( p = @ , p = @ ) , and the combined end point ( p = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	By multivariate analysis , only the simpler measures of MaxSTPost and High Risk categorization independently predicted all outcomes at both time points .
CONCLUSIONS	The STR following primary PCI in AMI correlates strongly with mortality and reinfarction , independent of target vessel patency .
CONCLUSIONS	The simple measure of the maximal residual degree of STE after primary PCI is a strong independent predictor of both survival and freedom from reinfarction at @ days and @ year .

BACKGROUND	Intestinal microbiota manipulation , one of the pathogenetic components of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , has become an attractive therapy for ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess in children with active distal UC the effectiveness of Lactobacillus ( L ) reuteri ATCC @ enema on inflammation and cytokine expression of rectal mucosa .
METHODS	A total of @ patients ( median age : @ years range @-@ ) with mild to moderate UC were enrolled in a prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled study .
METHODS	They received an enema solution containing @ ( @ ) CFU of L. reuteri ATCC @ or placebo for @ weeks , in addition to oral mesalazine .
METHODS	Clinical endoscopic and histological scores as well as rectal mucosal expression levels of IL-@ , IL-@ , TNF and IL-@ were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the trial .
RESULTS	Thirty-one patients accomplished the trial ( @ males , median age @ year , range @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Mayo score ( including clinical and endoscopic features ) decreased significantly in the L. reuteri group ( @ @ vs. @ @ , P < @ ) compared with placebo ( @ @ vs. @ @ , NS ) ; furthermore , histological score significantly decrease only in the L. reuteri group ( @ @ vs. @ @ , P < @ ) ( placebo : @ @ vs. @ @ , NS ) .
RESULTS	At the post-trial evaluation of cytokine mucosal expression levels , IL-@ significantly increased ( P < @ ) whereas IL-@ , TNF and IL-@ significantly decreased ( P < @ ) only in the L. reuteri group .
CONCLUSIONS	In children with active distal ulcerative colitis , rectal infusion of L. reuteri is effective in improving mucosal inflammation and changing mucosal expression levels of some cytokines involved in the mechanisms of inflammatory bowel disease .

BACKGROUND	The Western diet increases risk of metabolic disease .
OBJECTIVE	We determined whether lowering the ratio of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids in the Western diet would affect physical activity and energy expenditure .
METHODS	With the use of a balanced design , @ cohorts of @ and @ young adults were enrolled in separate randomized , double-masked , crossover trials that compared a @-wk high-palmitic acid diet ( HPA ; similar to the Western diet fat composition ) to a low-palmitic acid and high-oleic acid diet ( HOA ; similar to the Mediterranean diet fat composition ) .
METHODS	All foods were provided by the investigators , and the palmitic acid ( PA ) : oleic acid ( OA ) ratio was manipulated by adding different oil blends to the same foods .
METHODS	In both cohorts , we assessed physical activity ( monitored continuously by using accelerometry ) and resting energy expenditure ( REE ) .
METHODS	To gain insight into a possible mood disturbance that might explain changes in physical activity , the Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) was administered in cohort @ .
RESULTS	Physical activity was higher during the HOA than during the HPA in @ of @ subjects in cohort @ ( P = @ ) ( mean : @ % higher ; P = @ ) and in @ of @ subjects in the second , confirmatory cohort ( P = @ ) ( mean : @ % higher ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	When the HOA was compared with the HPA , REE measured during the fed state was @ % higher for cohort @ ( P < @ ) , and REE was @ % higher in the fasted state for cohort @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	POMS testing showed that the anger-hostility score was significantly higher during the HPA ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The replacement of dietary PA with OA was associated with increased physical activity and REE and less anger .
CONCLUSIONS	Besides presumed effects on mitochondrial function ( increased REE ) , the dietary PA : OA ratio appears to affect behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	The second cohort was derived from a study that was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as R@DK@ .

BACKGROUND	Taxanes are among the most active drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer , and , as a consequence , they have also been studied in the adjuvant setting .
METHODS	After breast cancer surgery , women with lymph node-positive disease were randomly assigned to treatment with fluorouracil , epirubicin , and cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) or with FEC followed by weekly paclitaxel ( FEC-P ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of study-@-year disease-free survival ( DFS ) - was assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included overall survival and analysis of the prognostic and predictive value of clinical and molecular ( hormone receptors by immunohistochemistry and HER@ by fluorescence in situ hybridization ) markers .
METHODS	Associations and interactions were assessed with a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model for DFS for the following covariates : age , menopausal status , tumor size , lymph node status , type of chemotherapy , tumor size , positive lymph nodes , HER@ status , and hormone receptor status .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	Among the @ eligible patients , estimated rates of DFS at @ years were @ % in the FEC-P arm and @ % in the FEC arm ( difference = @ % , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ % to @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	FEC-P treatment was associated with a @ % reduction in the risk of relapse compared with FEC treatment ( @ relapses in the @ patients in the FEC-P arm vs @ relapses in the @ patients in the FEC arm , hazard ratio [ HR ] = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) and a @ % reduction in the risk of death ( @ and @ deaths , respectively , HR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients for whom tumor samples were centrally analyzed , type of chemotherapy ( FEC vs FEC-P ) ( P = @ ) , number of involved axillary lymph nodes ( P < @ ) , tumor size ( P = @ ) , hormone receptor status ( P = @ ) , and HER@ status ( P = @ ) were all associated with DFS .
RESULTS	We found no statistically significant interaction between HER@ status and paclitaxel treatment or between hormone receptor status and paclitaxel treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients with operable breast cancer , FEC-P treatment statistically significantly reduced the risk of relapse compared with FEC as adjuvant therapy .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether acute dipterex poisoning ( ADP ) may cause oxidative stress and free radical damage in the bodies of acute dipterex poisoning patients ( ADPPs ) , and to explore the mechanisms by which ADP may cause oxidative stress and free radical damage .
METHODS	Fifty ADPPs and fifty healthy adult volunteers ( HAVs ) whose ages , gender and others were matched with the ADPPs were enrolled in a randomized controlled study , in which concentrations of nitric oxide ( NO ) , vitamin C ( VC ) , vitamin E ( VE ) and beta-carotene ( beta-CAR ) in plasma as well as concentration of lipoperoxide ( LPO ) , and activities of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , catalase ( CAT ) , glutathione peroxidase ( GPX ) and acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) in erythrocytes were determined by spectrophotometric analytical methods .
RESULTS	Compared with the average values of experimental parameters in the HAVs group , the average values of plasma NO and erythrocyte LPO in the ADPPs group were significantly increased ( P < @ ) , while those of plasma VC , VE and beta-CAR as well as erythrocyte SOD , CAT , GPX and AChE in the ADPPs group were significantly decreased ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Bivariate correlation analysis and partial correlation analysis suggested that when NO and LPO values were increased , and VC , VE , beta-CAR , SOD , CAT and GPX values were decreased in the ADPPs , AChE value was decreased gradually in the ADPPs ( P < @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Reliability analysis of experimental parameters reflecting oxidative stress and free radical damage in the ADPPs showed that the reliability coefficient ( @ items ) alpha = @ , and the standardized item alpha = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings in the present study suggest that ADP can cause oxidative stress and free radical damage , and inhibit markedly erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase activity in ADPPs .

OBJECTIVE	To examine whether low-dose aspirin ( @ mg on alternate days ) reduces the risk of age-related cataract and subtypes .
OBJECTIVE	This report extends previous findings , including both subtypes and additional newly identified incident cases since the earlier report .
METHODS	All @,@ participants in the Physicians ' Health Study , a randomized trial of aspirin and beta-carotene among U.S. male physicians age @-@ in @ , who did not report cataract at baseline were included .
METHODS	Average follow-up was five years .
METHODS	The main outcome measure was incident , age-related cataract responsible for a reduction in best-corrected visual acuity to @/@ or worse , based on self-report confirmed by medical record review .
RESULTS	@ age-related cataracts were diagnosed during follow-up , including @ with nuclear sclerosis and @ with a posterior subcapsular component ; @ cataracts progressed to surgical extraction .
RESULTS	Overall , there were @ cataracts in the aspirin group and @ in the placebo group ( relative risk [ RR ] , @ ; @ % confidence interval [ CI ] , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Cataract extractions were @ % less frequent in the aspirin than in the placebo group ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In subgroup analyses of subtypes , aspirin takers had a lower risk of posterior subcapsular cataract ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) but not nuclear sclerosis ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) cataract .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , these randomized trial data tend to exclude a large benefit of five years of low-dose aspirin therapy on cataract development and extraction .
CONCLUSIONS	The data are compatible with a modest benefit on cataract extraction for this duration of aspirin therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Subgroup analyses raise the possibility of a modest , but potentially important , protective effect of aspirin on posterior subcapsular cataract , a particularly disabling subtype .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the outcome in patients who underwent surgery for unstable intertrochanteric femoral fractures using the proximal femoral locking plate versus the dynamic hip screw ( DHS ) .
METHODS	@ men and @ women aged @ to @ ( mean , @ ) years were randomised to the proximal femoral locking plate group , whereas @ men and @ women aged @ to @ ( mean , @ ) years were randomised to the conventional @-degree DHS group .
METHODS	The time to union , medialisation of the shaft , neck-shaft angle , limb shortening , varus collapse , and functional outcome ( using the Hospital for Special Surgery Hip Rating System ) were assessed .
RESULTS	Respectively in the locking plate and DHS groups , the mean times to union were @ and @ weeks ( p = @ ) and the mean limb shortenings were @ and @ cm ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Medialisation of the shaft occurred in @ and @ patients ( p < @ ) ; varus collapse occurred in @ and @ patients ( p = @ ) ; the functional hip score was good-to-excellent in @ and @ patients ( p = @ ) ; deep wound infection occurred in @ and @ patients ; and implant cut-out occurred in one patient each group .
CONCLUSIONS	A non-collapsing locking plate achieved bone union in unstable intertrochanteric fractures with lower risks of limb shortening and medialisation of the shaft .

OBJECTIVE	A randomized clinical trial was undertaken to compare the therapeutic effectiveness of idarubicin ( IDR ) to daunorubicin ( DNR ) , and both were given in combination with cytarabine ( CA ) in acute myelogenous leukemic ( AML ) patients .
METHODS	Newly diagnosed patients were given a daily infusion of CA ( @ mg/m@ ) for @ days and were assigned randomly to receive DNR ( @ mg/m@ ) or IDR ( @ mg/m@ ) daily for the first @ days .
METHODS	Those patients who achieved a complete remission ( CR ) were given three consolidation courses that consisted of CA ( @ mg/m@ intravenously [ IV ] ) and thioguanine ( TG ; @ mg/m@ orally ) every @ hours for @ days and either DNR ( @ mg/m@ ) or IDR ( @ mg/m@ ) on the first day of each cycle .
METHODS	After consolidation , patients received late intensification , which consisted of the same drugs used for induction except that the CA was given for @ days and the anthracycline for @ days .
METHODS	Four courses were planned at @-week intervals .
RESULTS	The CR rates were @ of @ ( @ % ) on the IDR arm and @ of @ ( @ % ) on the DNR arm ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median survival and median remission durations were @ and @ days , respectively , on the IDR arm .
RESULTS	The median survival and median remission durations were @ and @ days , respectively , on the DNR arm .
RESULTS	Six deaths occurred during late intensification , five on IDR and one on DNR ; this approach was abandoned after @ patients were entered .
RESULTS	The median survival was significantly longer for patients who received late intensification .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial demonstrated that IDR was more effective than DNR in remission induction in AML .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether regional hyperthermia ( RHT ) in addition to chemotherapy improves local tumor control after macroscopically complete resection of abdominal or retroperitoneal high-risk sarcomas .
BACKGROUND	Within the prospectively randomized EORTC @ phase-III trial , RHT and systemic chemotherapy significantly improved local progression-free survival ( LPFS ) and disease-free survival ( DFS ) in patients with abdominal and extremity sarcomas .
BACKGROUND	That trial included macroscopically complete and R@ resections .
METHODS	A subgroup analysis of the EORTC trial was performed and long-term survival determined .
METHODS	From @ patients , @ ( median age @ years , @-@ ) were identified with macroscopic complete resection ( R@ , R@ ) of abdominal and retroperitoneal soft-tissue sarcomas ( median diameter @ cm , G@ @ % , G@ @ % ) .
METHODS	Seventy-six patients were treated with EIA ( etoposide , ifosfamide , doxorubicin ) + RHT ( @ cycles : @ % ) versus @ patients receiving EIA alone ( @ cycles : @ % , P = @ ) .
METHODS	LPFS and DFS as well as overall survival were determined .
RESULTS	RHT and systemic chemotherapy significantly improved LPFS ( @ % vs @ % after @ years , P = @ ) and DFS ( @ % vs @ % after @ years , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall survival was not significantly improved in the RHT group ( @ % vs @ % after @ years , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Perioperative morbidity and mortality were not significantly different between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with macroscopically complete tumor resection , RHT in addition to chemotherapy resulted in significantly improved local tumor control and DFS without increasing surgical complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Within a multimodal therapeutic concept for abdominal and retroperitoneal high-risk sarcomas , RHT is a treatment option beside radical surgery and should be further evaluated in future trials .

BACKGROUND	Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) - associated interstitial pneumonia is a major cause of death after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection .
BACKGROUND	We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia .
METHODS	After bone marrow transplantation , @ patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day @ .
METHODS	The @ patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone .
METHODS	Ganciclovir ( @ mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously ) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day @ .
RESULTS	Of the @ culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir , @ ( @ percent ) died or had CMV pneumonia before day @ , as compared with @ of the @ culture-positive control patients ( @ percent ) who were not treated prophylactically ( relative risk , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia .
RESULTS	Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to @ mumol per liter ( @ mg per deciliter ) , as compared with none of the controls ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Of the @ CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated , @ ( @ percent ) had CMV pneumonia -- a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients ( relative risk , @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture , both from specimens obtained on day @ .
CONCLUSIONS	In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow , asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection .

METHODS	A multicenter randomized study with a @-year follow-up period and an independent observer was conducted .
OBJECTIVE	To compare three commonly used surgical techniques to achieve lumbar fusion primarily in terms of their ability to reduce pain and decrease disability in patients with severe chronic low back pain .
BACKGROUND	Lumbar fusion can be used to reduce pain and decrease disability in patients with chronic low back pain , and different surgical techniques are available .
BACKGROUND	The reported results after fusion surgery vary considerably , but most studies are retrospective and/or performed on heterogeneous patient groups .
BACKGROUND	Spine surgeons commonly use the techniques presented in this report .
BACKGROUND	However , in the absence of randomized trials it is difficult to know whether any one of them is better than the others for these patients .
METHODS	From @ through @ , @ patients referred to @ spinal centers were blindly randomized into four treatment groups : three surgical groups ( n = @ ) and one nonsurgical group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics did not differ among the groups .
METHODS	Eligibility included patients @ to @ years of age with therapy-resistant chronic low back pain that had persisted for at least @ years and radiologic evidence of disc degeneration ( spondylosis ) at L@-L@ , L@-S@ , or both .
METHODS	Only patients randomized to one of three surgical groups were analyzed in the current study : Group @ ( posterolateral fusion ; n = @ ) , Group @ ( posterolateral fusion combined with variable screw placement , an internal fixation device ; n = @ ) , and Group @ ( posterolateral fusion combined with variable screw placement and interbody fusion ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	The `` circumferential fusion '' in Group @ was performed either as an anterior lumbar interbody fusion ( n = @ ) or as a biomechanically similar posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The groups were composed of @ % , @ % , and @ % men respectively , and the respective mean ages were @ , @ , and @ years .
METHODS	The patients had experienced low back pain for at least @ years ( mean , approximately @ years ) .
METHODS	They had been on sick leave for approximately @ years .
METHODS	Pain was measured by a visual analog scale , and disability was assessed by the Oswestry Low Back Pain Questionnaire , the Million Visual Analogue Score , and the General Function Score .
METHODS	Depressive symptoms were measured by the Zung Depression Scale .
METHODS	The global overall rating of the result was assessed by the patient and an independent observer after @ years .
METHODS	Hospitalization data including operation time , blood loss , blood transfusion , and days of hospitalization in connection with surgery were reported , along with complications and the fusion rate .
METHODS	Records from the Swedish Social Insurance Board providing information on sick leave and economic compensation for Swedish residents were used to evaluate the patients ' work status .
RESULTS	An independent observer examined @ ( @ % ) of @ patients after @ years , after @ `` group changers '' and @ dropouts had been excluded from the analyses .
RESULTS	All surgical techniques were found to reduce pain and decrease disability substantially , but no significant differences were found among the groups .
RESULTS	In all three groups , the patients rated the overall outcome similarly , as did the independent observer .
RESULTS	The more demanding techniques in Groups @ and @ consumed significantly more resources in terms of operation time , blood transfusions , and days in hospital after surgery .
RESULTS	The early complication rate was @ % in Group @ , @ % in Group @ , and @ % in Group @ .
RESULTS	The fusion rate , as evaluated by plain radiograph , was @ % in Group @ , @ % in Group @ , and @ % in Group @ .
CONCLUSIONS	All the fusion techniques used in the study could reduce pain and improve function in this selected group of patients with severe chronic low back pain .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no obvious disadvantage in using the least demanding surgical technique of posterolateral fusion without internal fixation .

OBJECTIVE	The effects of potent statins on oxidized lipoprotein biomarkers are not well defined .
RESULTS	The VISION ( Value of oxIdant lipid lowering effect by Statin InterventiON in hypercholesterolemia ) Trial randomized patients with hypercholesterolemia to @-week administration of pitavastatin @mg/day ( n = @ ) or atorvastatin @mg/day ( n = @ ) and a variety of lipoprotein oxidative biomarkers were measured .
RESULTS	Between-group analysis did not reveal any differences except in the ratio of malondialdehyde ( MDA ) - LDL over apolipoprotein B-@ ( MDA-LDL/apoB ) in pitavastatin vs. atorvastatin group ( -@ % vs.-@ @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Within-group changes from baseline to @-week revealed significant increases in OxPL/apoB and reductions in small-dense LDL , MDA-LDL , and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A ( @ ) measured on circulating apoB particles ( Lp-PLA ( @ ) / apoB ) in both groups and significant reductions in OxPL/apoAI in the atorvastatin group .
CONCLUSIONS	The VISION study describes the first comparison on lipoprotein oxidation biomarkers between pitavastatin and atorvastatin and suggests diverse effects on lipoprotein oxidation markers in patients with hypercholesterolemia .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate the costs , benefits and cost effectiveness , from the UK NHS perspective , of fluvastatin ( relative to no HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor [ statin ] ) for the secondary prevention of major adverse cardiac events following a successful first percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
METHODS	A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using efficacy data from the Lescol Intervention Prevention Study ( LIPS ) .
METHODS	LIPS was a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial undertaken in @ centres ( predominantly in Europe ) .
METHODS	Patients included in the trial had moderate hypercholesterolaemia and had successfully undergone their first PCI .
METHODS	Fluvastatin ( Lescol ) @ mg twice daily plus dietary counselling was given to the intervention group for up to @ years ; the control group received dietary counselling only .
METHODS	A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs per QALY gained over a @-year period , with cost data drawn from the UK NHS ( @ values ) .
METHODS	Monte Carlo simulations and multivariate analysis were used to assess uncertainty .
METHODS	Costs were discounted at @ % per annum , and health outcomes at @ % per annum .
RESULTS	On average , treatment with fluvastatin cost an additional pound @ ( SD pound @ ) [ euro @ ; SD euro @ ] per patient and resulted in an additional @ ( SD @ ) QALYs per patient over @ years compared with controls .
RESULTS	The incremental cost per QALY gained with fluvastatin versus the control group was pound @ ( SD pound @,@ ) [ euro @,@ ; SD euro @,@ ] .
RESULTS	Fluvastatin was dominant ( better outcomes and lower costs ) in @ % of the simulations and was dominated in @ % .
RESULTS	The key determinants of cost effectiveness were : the effectiveness of fluvastatin in reducing acute myocardial infarction , subsequent PCI , coronary artery bypass graft and cardiac deaths ; the utility weight associated with a subsequent post-PCI state ; the cost of fluvastatin ; and the time horizon evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	Fluvastatin is the only statin which has proven effective in preventing major coronary adverse events in new PCI patients ; other statins lack this evidence .
CONCLUSIONS	This Markov model , with its underlying assumptions and data , suggests that fluvastatin is a viable and economically efficient pharmaceutical ( relative to no statin ) to reduce heart disease in the UK when given routinely to all patients following PCI .

BACKGROUND	Several recent studies suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can temporarily reduce pain perception in neuropathic pain patients and in healthy adults using laboratory pain models .
BACKGROUND	No studies have investigated the effects of prefrontal cortex stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation on postoperative pain .
METHODS	Twenty gastric bypass surgery patients were randomly assigned to receive @ min of either active or sham left prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation immediately after surgery .
METHODS	Patient-controlled analgesia pump use was tracked , and patients also rated pain and mood twice per day using visual analog scales .
RESULTS	Groups were similar at baseline in terms of body mass index , age , mood ratings , pain ratings , surgery duration , time under anesthesia , and surgical anesthesia methods .
RESULTS	Significant effects were observed for surgery type ( open vs. laparoscopic ) and condition ( active vs. sham transcranial magnetic stimulation ) on the cumulative amount of patient-delivered morphine during the @ h after surgery .
RESULTS	Active prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was associated with a @ % reduction in total morphine use compared with sham during the @ h after surgery .
RESULTS	The effect seemed to be most prominent during the first @ h after cortical stimulation delivery .
RESULTS	No effects were observed for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on mood ratings .
CONCLUSIONS	A single session of postoperative prefrontal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation was associated with a reduction in patient-controlled analgesia pump use in gastric bypass surgery patients .
CONCLUSIONS	This is important because the risks associated with postoperative morphine use are high , especially among obese patients who frequently have obstructive sleep apnea , right ventricular dysfunction , and pulmonary hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	These preliminary findings suggest a potential new noninvasive method for managing postoperative morphine use .

BACKGROUND	Because the life expectancy of individuals continues to increase , dentists providing dental implant treatment can expect to see an increasing number of patients with diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	Today , there are little data available concerning the clinical outcomes involving the use of implant treatment for patients with diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	There are three types of diabetes mellitus : Type @ ( insulin dependent ) , Type @ ( non-insulin dependent ) , and gestational .
BACKGROUND	Because of possible complications from patients with diabetes mellitus , they are excluded from participation in most clinical studies of endosseous dental implant survival .
METHODS	This study attempted to determine if Type @ diabetes represents a significant risk factor to the long-term clinical performance of dental implants , using the comprehensive DICRG database .
METHODS	Diabetes was a possible exclusion criterion ; however , the final decision on Type @ patients was left to the dental implant team at the research center .
METHODS	A total of @,@ implants ( @ patients ) were surgically placed , restored , and followed for a period of @ months .
METHODS	Of these , @,@ ( @ % ) implants were placed in non-diabetic patients and @ ( @ % ) in Type @ patients .
METHODS	Failures ( survival ) were compared using descriptive data .
METHODS	Possible clustering was also studied .
RESULTS	A model assuming independence showed that implants in Type @ patients have significantly more failures ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , if correlations among implants within the patient are considered , the significance level becomes marginal ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The experience of the surgeon did not produce a clinically significant improvement in implant survival .
RESULTS	The use of chlorhexidine rinses following implant placement resulted in a slight improvement ( @ % ) in survival in non-Type @ patients and a greater improvement in Type @ patients ( @ % ) ; the use of preoperative antibiotics improved survival by @ % in non-Type @ patients and @ % in Type @ patients .
RESULTS	The use of HA-coated implants improved survival by @ % in Type @ diabetics .
CONCLUSIONS	Type @ diabetic patients tend to have more failures than non-diabetic patients ; however , the influence was marginally significant .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings need to be confirmed by other scientific clinical studies with a larger Type @ diabetic sample size .

OBJECTIVE	The use of peripherally inserted central venous catheters ( PICC lines ) has reduced the mortality and morbidity of premature newborns .
OBJECTIVE	The usual sites of insertion are the veins in the upper arms but other locations are being used as well .
METHODS	To examine whether using the axillary vein as a site of insertion of a PICC line affects the frequency of complications .
METHODS	Our study has a clinical trial design .
METHODS	A total of @ neonates that had a PICC line inserted were recruited and randomly divided equally in two groups : in Group A ( mean birth weight , standard deviation ( s.d. ) = @ ( @ ) g ) , the PICC line was inserted through the axillary vein , and in Group B ( birth weight = @ ( @ ) g ) , the PICC line was inserted in other sites further from the axillary vein .
METHODS	The outcomes measured were the total PICC line-related complications , the reason for removing the catheter , the number of total attempts until successful insertion and the mean duration of stay of the catheter .
METHODS	The likelihood of having an adverse outcome was assessed with Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio ( OR ) .
RESULTS	Premature neonates with axillary PICC lines were @ times less likely to have line-related complications ( inflammation , blockage , edema , infection ) as compared with any other site of insertion ( OR = @ % , confidence interval ( CI ) = @ ( @ to @ ) ) and they were seven times more likely to have the PICC line removed because they achieved full enteral nutrition as compared with the other causes ( OR @ % , confidence interval ( CI ) = @ ( @ to @ ) ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistical difference between the two groups in the number of attempts until successful PICC line insertion ( P = @ ) and the mean duration of stay of the PICC line ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of the axillary vein as a site of insertion of a PICC line was correlated with significantly less complications in premature newborns as opposed to the other sites of insertion .

OBJECTIVE	We evaluated female-condom use among women participating in an HIV/STD intervention designed to reduce unprotected sex and expand prevention strategies .
METHODS	Women ( n = @ ) were recruited from a family-planning clinic and were randomized into an @ - or @-session intervention group or a control group .
METHODS	We conducted follow-up interviews at @ , @ , and @ months .
RESULTS	At @ month , the odds ratios of first-time female-condom use were @ ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ , @ ) in the @-session group and @ ( @ % CI = @ , @ ) in the @-session group relative to controls .
RESULTS	Repeated use ( n = @ ) was predicted by perceived ability to use , by self and partner satisfaction , by dislike of male condoms , and by previous diaphragm use .
CONCLUSIONS	Gender sensitive cognitive-behavioral interventions can influence women to try the female condom .
CONCLUSIONS	To increase long-term use , interventions may need to include self-insertion practice and involvement of male partners .

BACKGROUND	This study tested the hypothesis that statins may reduce left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) in patients with hypertension and LVH .
METHODS	A prospective randomised open-label study with blinded endpoints assessment was performed in @ patients .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria were hypertension , left ventricular ejection fraction @ % and echocardiographic determined LVH , defined as a left ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) of @ g/m ( @ ) in women and @ g/m ( @ ) in males .
METHODS	Patients were randomised between rosuvastatin @mg once daily vs control .
METHODS	For each patient an echocardiogram and blood samples were obtained .
METHODS	These tests were repeated after @ months .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics : mean age was @ @year and @ ( @ % ) were male .
RESULTS	In both groups , there was a non-significant reduction in LVMI : @ @ to @ @ g/m ( @ ) in the control group and @ @ to @ @ in the rosuvastatin group ( p = @ for the comparison between rosuvastatin and control after @ months ) .
RESULTS	After six months , LDL-cholesterol was reduced from @ @ to @ @ mmol/L ( @ % reduction ) in the rosuvastatin group and remained unchanged in the control group ( @ @ vs @ @ mmol/L .
RESULTS	Hs-CRP decreased more with rosuvastatin compared to control ( -@ % vs -@ % , p = @ ) There was no significant reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels after @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Rosuvastatin does not reduce LVH despite a large LDL reduction in patients with hypertension and LVH .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this research was to determine the impact of pretreatment Helicobacter pylori infection on gastric ulcer healing rates in patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and antisecretory medications .
METHODS	This was a pooled , prospective analysis of two identical double blind , multicenter , parallel group studies .
METHODS	Six hundred ninety-two patients receiving NSAIDs and with endoscopy-documented gastric ulcers were enrolled from @ North American sites in primary care and referral centers .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive ranitidine ( @ mg b.i.d. ) or lansoprazole ( @ mg or @ mg once daily ) for @ wk .
METHODS	Ulcer healing was assessed by endoscopy at @ and @ wk in an intent-to-treat population .
METHODS	H. pylori status was determined at baseline by histology .
RESULTS	Across all three treatment groups , gastric ulcers were more likely to heal and heal faster if the individual was infected with H. pylori .
RESULTS	Healing rates at @ wk were statistically significantly greater among H. pylori positive patients ( n = @ ) than among negative patients ( n = @ ) ( @ % vs @ % , respectively ; p < @ ) , especially among those with large ulcers ( > @ mm ) and in younger patients ( < @ yr old ) .
RESULTS	Simple healing rates ( regardless of H. pylori status ) were significantly better in the @ - and @-mg lansoprazole groups than in the ranitidine group after @ wk ( @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively ; p < or = @ ) and @ wk ( @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients receiving NSAIDs , gastric ulcer healing with an antisecretory agent is significantly enhanced in the presence of H. pylori infection .

BACKGROUND	To compare the incidence and timing of bone fractures in postmenopausal women treated with @ years of adjuvant tamoxifen or letrozole for endocrine-responsive early breast cancer in the Breast International Group ( BIG ) @-@ trial .
METHODS	We evaluated @ patients allocated to @ years of letrozole or tamoxifen in the BIG @-@ trial who received at least some study medication ( median follow-up @ months ) .
METHODS	Bone fracture information ( grade , cause , site ) was collected every @ months during trial treatment .
RESULTS	The incidence of bone fractures was higher among patients treated with letrozole [ @ of @ women ( @ % ) ] versus tamoxifen [ @ of @ women ( @ % ) ] .
RESULTS	The wrist was the most common site of fracture in both treatment groups .
RESULTS	Statistically significant risk factors for bone fractures during treatment included age , smoking history , osteoporosis at baseline , previous bone fracture , and previous hormone replacement therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Consistent with other trials comparing aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen , letrozole was associated with an increase in bone fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	Benefits of superior disease control associated with letrozole and lower incidence of fracture with tamoxifen should be considered with the risk profile for individual patients .

OBJECTIVE	Of all stroke survivors , @ % to @ % are unable to use their affected arm in performing activities of daily living .
OBJECTIVE	Although forced use therapy appears to improve arm function in chronic stroke patients , there is no conclusive evidence .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluates the effectiveness of forced use therapy .
METHODS	In an observer-blinded randomized clinical trial , @ chronic stroke patients were allocated to either forced use therapy ( immobilization of the unaffected arm combined with intensive training ) or a reference therapy of equally intensive bimanual training , based on Neuro-Developmental Treatment , for a period of @ weeks .
METHODS	Outcomes were evaluated on the basis of the Rehabilitation Activities Profile ( activities ) , the Action Research Arm ( ARA ) test ( dexterity ) , the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale , the Motor Activity Log ( MAL ) , and a Problem Score .
METHODS	The minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) was determined at the onset of the study .
RESULTS	One week after the last treatment session , a significant difference in effectiveness in favor of the forced use group compared with the bimanual group ( corrected for baseline differences ) was found for the ARA score ( @ points ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; MCID , @ points ) and the MAL amount of use score ( @ points ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; MCID , @ ) .
RESULTS	The other parameters revealed no significant differential effects .
RESULTS	One-year follow-up effects were observed only for the ARA .
RESULTS	The differences in treatment effect for the ARA and the MAL amount of use scores were clinically relevant for patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study showed a small but lasting effect of forced use therapy on the dexterity of the affected arm ( ARA ) and a temporary clinically relevant effect on the amount of use of the affected arm during activities of daily living ( MAL amount of use ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect of forced use therapy was clinically relevant in the subgroups of patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect , respectively .

OBJECTIVE	Consumption of fish and marine n-@ polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA ) may be associated with a lower risk of atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , but results have been inconsistent .
OBJECTIVE	The aim was to investigate this further by measurements of marine n-@ PUFA in adipose tissue .
METHODS	Cohort study .
METHODS	A total of @ @ Danish participants @-@ years of age were enrolled into the Diet , Cancer and Health Cohort Study .
METHODS	A randomly drawn subcohort of @ participants with available data from baseline adipose tissue biopsies .
METHODS	Exposure was the adipose tissue content of marine n-@ PUFA , which reflects the endogenous exposure and is also an objective marker of the long-term dietary intake .
METHODS	Incident AF during follow-up .
RESULTS	@ cases of AF occurred over @ years .
RESULTS	Multivariate , sex-stratified Cox proportional hazards regression analyses using cubic splines showed a monotonic , negative , dose-response trend , but not statistically significant association , between total marine n-@ PUFA in adipose tissue and incident AF .
RESULTS	A similar trend towards a lower risk of AF was seen in the second ( HR @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) and third tertiles ( HR @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) of marine n-@ PUFA compared with the lowest tertile .
RESULTS	Similar trends , but also not statistically significant , were found separately for eicosapentaenoic , docosahexaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no statistically significant association between the content of marine n-@ PUFA in adipose tissue and the development of AF ; however , data showed a monotonic , negative dose-response trend suggestive of a negative association .

BACKGROUND	The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of myocardial protection during coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) in cold blood intermittent ( CBIC ) and warm continuous blood cardioplegia ( WCBC ) .
BACKGROUND	To assess myocardial necrosis , Troponin T , a structural protein belonging to the troponin complex , was measured .
BACKGROUND	Troponin T is released in the blood stream @ hours after myocardial damage , and it does not cross-react with the isomeric form of the skeletal muscle .
METHODS	Our study involved @ consecutive patients , scheduled for isolated CABG .
METHODS	They were divided into two groups : the first group ( @ patients ; @ m , @ f ) underwent surgery with the use of CBIC , the second group ( @ patients ; @ m , @ f ) with WCBC .
METHODS	The serum levels of cardiac Troponin T ( cTn-T ) were all < @ microg/l before operation .
RESULTS	In the CBIC the mean cTn-T peaked on the @st day after CABG , in the WCBC group the first peak occurred in the @nd hour after arrival in the intensive care unit , and the second peak occurred on the @th day postoperatively .
RESULTS	The mean serum cTn-T was lower in the WCBC vs CBIC group from the @st to the @th day postoperatively , with a statistical difference on the @st day ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the CBIC group either the cTn-T peak values ( r = @ ; p < @ ) or area under the concentration curve of cTn-T release ( r = @ ; p < @ ) , were directly correlated with the aortic cross-clamping time .
RESULTS	This was not demonstrated in the WCBC .
RESULTS	CPK and CK-MB peaked in both groups @ hours after arrival in the intensive care unit and on the @st day postoperatively , with higher values at @ hours in the WCBC group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The CK-MB/CPK ratio was significantly lower in the WCBC group at the six hours ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this preliminary study suggest that fewer necrosis markers are released during CABG in the WCBC group ; in the CBIC group the release of cTn-T whether measured by peak serum level or by area under the curve , shows a statistically significant correlation with cross-clamping time .
CONCLUSIONS	Warm blood cardioplegia is safe and supplies adequate myocardial protection during CABG ; the more prolonged cross-clamping is , the more myocardial protection is afforded by WCBC .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the individual and combined effects of exercise and weight loss on the cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac left ventricular structure and function in overweight individuals .
METHODS	A randomized , parallel-group , crossover study design was adopted .
METHODS	The following treatments were employed : exercise three times a week at @ % maximum work capacity for @ min ; dietary modification to achieve weight loss involving @ kj/day dietary restriction ; and a combination of both exercise and dietary modification weight-loss programmes .
METHODS	Each subject was randomly assigned to one group only and was studied after a @-week treatment and @-week control period , performed in a random order .
METHODS	Thirty subjects entered the trial , @ completing both treatment and control phases .
RESULTS	Body weight remained unchanged with exercise alone and fell significantly both with weight loss and with the combination .
RESULTS	The corresponding effects on blood pressure were also significant .
RESULTS	Exercising groups also showed a significant increase in maximal oxygen consumption and a reduction in heart rate .
RESULTS	Serum cholesterol and triglycerides fell significantly only after the combination , whereas high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol increased with exercise , decreased with weight loss and did not change with the combination .
RESULTS	Interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness measurements remained unchanged after @ weeks ' treatment in all groups .
RESULTS	No significant changes occurred in left ventricular internal diastolic diameter , wall thickness : radius ratio or the heart rate corrected ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity : peak late diastolic filling velocity .
RESULTS	Left ventricular mass and mass indexed to body surface area were not changed in any group .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that the effects of exercise and weight reduction on blood pressure are additive , although a positive interaction may exist with respect to lipids .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite lowering blood pressure , exercise and weight loss had no effect on cardiac left ventricular structure or function in these overweight individuals .

OBJECTIVE	The risk of stroke is greater among women with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) than men .
OBJECTIVE	Warfarin protects against stroke , but treatment-related bleeding occurs more often in women than in men .
RESULTS	SPORTIF III ( open label , n = @ ) and V ( double-blind , n = @ ) included @ women with AF and one or more stroke risk factors randomized to warfarin [ target international normalized ratio ( INR ) @-@ @ ] or ximelagatran ( @ mg twice daily ) .
RESULTS	Primary outcomes were all stroke ( ischaemic/haemorrhagic ) and systemic embolic event .
RESULTS	Women were older , on average , than men , @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ years ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	More women were > @-years old and women had more risk factors than men had ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The INR on warfarin ( mean @ + / -@ ) was within target range for @ % of follow-up regardless of gender .
RESULTS	Women more often developed primary events [ @ % / year , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ % / year vs. @ % / year , @ % CI @-@ @ % / year in men ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Major bleeding rates were similar ( P = @ ) but women experienced more overall ( major/minor ) bleeding ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Warfarin was associated with more overall bleeding in both genders and more major bleeding in women than in men ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When compared with men with AF , women in these studies were older and had more stroke risk factors .
CONCLUSIONS	Women were more prone to anticoagulant-related bleeding ; the higher rate of thrombo-embolism among women was related to more frequent interruption of anticoagulant therapy .

BACKGROUND	Phylloquinone , found in dark-green vegetables and certain plant oils , is the primary dietary source of the fat-soluble vitamin K. Limited data suggest that the relative bioavailability of phylloquinone from vegetables is lower than that from a supplement .
BACKGROUND	This finding is relevant to the maintenance of optimal vitamin K status .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to compare , in younger and older adults , the relative bioavailability of phylloquinone from a vegetable with that of a fortified oil .
METHODS	In a crossover design with three @-d residency periods in a metabolic unit , younger and older men and women ( n = @ ) consumed a mixed diet containing @ microg phylloquinone/d .
METHODS	During @ residency periods , the mixed diet was supplemented for @ d with either broccoli ( @ microg phylloquinone/d ; broccoli diet ) or phylloquinone-fortified oil ( @ microg/d ; oil diet ) .
METHODS	The relative bioavailability of phylloquinone was defined by the difference in plasma phylloquinone , percentage serum undercarboxylated osteocalcin ( % ucOC ) , and urinary gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in response to @ d of supplementation .
RESULTS	For both younger and older adults , plasma phylloquinone concentrations were higher ( P < @ ) and % ucOC values were lower ( P = @ ) after the broccoli and oil diets than after the mixed diet only .
RESULTS	Overall , the response to broccoli supplementation was not significantly different from the response to the fortified oil in either age group .
RESULTS	Urinary gamma-carboxyglutamic acid did not change in response to supplementation .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no significant difference in the relative bioavailability of phylloquinone , as evidenced by the lack of a significant difference in plasma phylloquinone and % ucOC between the @ groups after either the broccoli or oil diets for younger and older adults .

OBJECTIVE	To determine advantages of therapy of functional class ( FC ) I-II chronic heart failure ( CHF ) with preserved left ventricular ( LV ) ejection fraction in patients with hypertensive disease ( HD ) with metoprolol succinate or quinapril and to assess their effect on regulatory-adaptive status .
METHODS	Two hundred patients with I-II FC CHF and LVEF > @ % at the background of stage I-II hypertensive disease participated in this study .
METHODS	They were randomized into @ groups .
METHODS	Group I comprised @ patients ( mean age @ +@ years ) who were prescribed metoprolol succinate @ + / -@ mg/day .
METHODS	Patients of group @ ( n = @ , mean age @ + / -@ years ) were prescribed quinapril @ +@ mg/day .
METHODS	Examination at baseline and after @ months of therapy included @ min walk test , treadmillometry with assessment of maximal oxygen consumptiion ( VO@max ) , echocardiography , @ hour blood pressure monitoring , measurement of N-terminal precursor of brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) ; test of cardio-respiratory synchronism was used for objective qualitative determination of the state of the , renin-angiotensin system .
RESULTS	Both drugs improved parameters of LV diastolic function , but only quinapril effectively changed LV structural geometric parameters and systolic function .
RESULTS	Only treatment with quinapril was associated with improvement of RAS , elevation of tolerance to physical effort , and increased VO@max .
RESULTS	Quinapril more substantially lowered level of NT-proBNP .
CONCLUSIONS	Quinapril has an advantage over metoprolol succinate in therapy of patients with FC I-II CHF and preserved LF EF at the background of stage I-II HD .

OBJECTIVE	Oral estrogens reduce asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) , an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase , and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease .
OBJECTIVE	This study was conducted to compare the effect on ADMA between intranasal and oral @beta-estradiol ( E@ ) combined with norethisterone ( acetate ) ( NET ( A ) ) administration in postmenopausal women .
METHODS	In a two-center , randomized , double-blind , comparative study @ healthy postmenopausal women ( age @ + / -@ years ) received daily continuous combined intranasal E@/NET @ microg/@ microg ( n = @ ) or oral E@/NETA @ mg/@ @ mg ( n = @ ) for one year .
METHODS	At baseline , week @ and @ , plasma concentrations of ADMA , arginine and symmetric dimethylarginine ( SDMA ) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography .
RESULTS	Oral E@/NETA reduced ADMA concentrations ( -@ % ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ to -@ % ) , while intranasal E@/NET had no effect ( -@ % ; @ % CI -@ to @ % ) after @ weeks .
RESULTS	In both groups , arginine was transiently decreased compared to baseline at week @ ( intranasal : -@ % ; @ % CI -@ to -@ % ; oral : -@ % ; @ % CI -@ to -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Only oral E@/NETA reduced SDMA concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral administration of E@/NETA reduced ADMA and SDMA concentrations , whereas intranasal administration did not .
CONCLUSIONS	Both treatments transiently reduced arginine .
CONCLUSIONS	The decrease in ADMA by oral estrogens could be a key phenomenon in the modulation of nitric oxide synthesis by postmenopausal hormone therapy .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect of inhaled budesonide given daily or as-needed on mild persistent childhood asthma .
OBJECTIVE	Patients , design and
METHODS	@ children aged @-@ years with newly detected asthma were randomly assigned to three treatment groups : ( @ ) continuous budesonide ( @ microg twice daily for @ month , @ microg twice daily for months @-@ , @ microg twice daily for months @-@ ) ; ( @ ) budesonide , identical treatment to group @ during months @-@ , then budesonide for exacerbations as needed for months @-@ ; and ( @ ) disodium cromoglycate ( DSCG ) @ mg three times daily for months @-@ .
METHODS	Exacerbations were treated with budesonide @ microg twice daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	Lung function , the number of exacerbations and growth .
RESULTS	Compared with DSCG the initial regular budesonide treatment resulted in a significantly improved lung function , fewer exacerbations and a small but significant decline in growth velocity .
RESULTS	After @ months , however , the lung function improvements did not differ between the groups .
RESULTS	During months @-@ , patients receiving continuous budesonide treatment had significantly fewer exacerbations ( mean @ ) , compared with @ in group @ and @ in group @ .
RESULTS	The number of asthma-free days did not differ between regular and intermittent budesonide treatment .
RESULTS	Growth velocity was normalised during continuous low-dose budesonide and budesonide therapy given as needed .
RESULTS	The latter was associated with catch-up growth .
CONCLUSIONS	Regular use of budesonide afforded better asthma control but had a more systemic effect than did use of budesonide as needed .
CONCLUSIONS	The dose of ICS could be reduced as soon as asthma is controlled .
CONCLUSIONS	Some children do not seem to need continuous ICS treatment .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine if vital tooth whitening affects oral health-related quality of life ( OHRQOL ) in adults age @ years and older , and if tooth whitening causes increased participation in social activities .
METHODS	Using a @ group , single blind , randomized , pre-test , multiple post-test design , @ participants were enrolled .
METHODS	The experimental group used a whitening product twice daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	The control group used no whitening products .
METHODS	The Oral Health Impact Profile ( OHIP ) served as the pre - and post-test measure .
METHODS	The OHIP measures OHRQOL on @ subscales : functional factors , psychological disabilities , psychological discomforts , physical disabilities , social disabilities , handicaps and physical pain .
METHODS	Additional questions measured the subjects ' social activities at baseline , @ weeks and @ months .
METHODS	Data from @ participants , who completed the study , were analyzed using paired t-tests and ANOVA at p = @ .
RESULTS	Statistical significance was observed for the OHIP physical pain subscale ( p = @ ) and the handicap subscale ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pre - to post-test means of the physical pain subscale increased in the experimental group ( @ to @ ) , suggesting a lower OHRQOL , most likely related to tooth sensitivity experienced by the experimental group .
RESULTS	Means from pre - to post-test of the handicap subscale ( @ to @ ) reveal that the experimental group reported an improved OHRQOL and felt they were more willing to work .
RESULTS	Repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey 's post-hoc tests revealed that the experimental group reported significantly less ( p = @ ) social activities at the @ month post-test ( @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	No statistically significant between-group differences were observed in the overall OHIP score for functional factors , psychological disabilities , psychological discomforts , physical disabilities and social disabilities .
CONCLUSIONS	Results indicate that vital tooth whitening does not improve overall OHRQOL in older adults .

OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that a unique tock and voice metronome could prevent both suboptimal chest compression rates and hyperventilation .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , parallel design study involving @ pairs of paid firefighter/emergency medical technicians ( EMTs ) performing two-rescuer CPR using a Laerdal SkillReporter Resusci Anne manikin with and without metronome guidance was performed .
METHODS	Each CPR session consisted of @ min of @:@ CPR with an unsecured airway , then @ min of CPR with a secured airway ( continuous compressions at @ min ( -@ ) with @-@ ventilations/min ) , repeated after the rescuers switched roles .
METHODS	The metronome provided `` tock '' prompts for compressions , transition prompts between compressions and ventilations , and a spoken `` ventilate '' prompt .
RESULTS	During CPR with a bag/valve/mask the target compression rate of @-@ min ( -@ ) was achieved in @/@ CPR sessions ( @ % ) for the control group and @/@ sessions ( @ % ) for the metronome group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	An excessive ventilation rate was not observed in either the metronome or control group during CPR with a bag/valve/mask .
RESULTS	During CPR with a bag/endotracheal tube , the target of both a compression rate of @-@ min ( -@ ) and a ventilation rate of @-@ min ( -@ ) was achieved in @/@ CPR sessions ( @ % ) for the control group and @/@ sessions ( @ % ) for the metronome group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Metronome use with the secured airway scenario significantly decreased the incidence of over-ventilation ( @/@ EMT pairs vs. @/@ EMT pairs ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A unique combination tock and voice prompting metronome was effective at directing correct chest compression and ventilation rates both before and after intubation .

BACKGROUND	Exenatide once weekly ( QW ) is an extended-release formulation of exenatide , a glucagon-like peptide-@ receptor agonist that reportedly improves glycemic control in patients with type @ diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that exenatide QW is noninferior to insulin glargine , as measured by change in glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA ( @c ) ) from baseline to end point ( week @ [ primary end point ] ) in Japanese patients with type @ diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with oral antidiabetes drugs .
METHODS	In this open-label , parallel-group , multicenter , noninferiority registration study , patients were randomized ( @:@ ) to add exenatide QW ( @ mg ) or once-daily insulin glargine ( starting dose , @ U ) to their current oral antidiabetes drug treatment .
METHODS	The primary analysis was change in HbA ( @c ) from baseline to end point , evaluated by using a last-observation-carried-forward ANCOVA model , with a predefined noninferiority margin of @ % .
METHODS	Secondary analyses ( a priori ) included analysis of superiority for between-group comparisons of change in weight and the proportion of patients reaching HbA ( @c ) target levels of @ % or @ % .
RESULTS	The baseline characteristics of the exenatide QW ( @ patients ) and insulin glargine ( @ patients ) treatment groups were similar : mean ( SD ) age , @ ( @ ) years and @ ( @ ) years , respectively ; @ % and @ % male ; mean HbA ( @c ) , @ % ( @ % ) and @ % ( @ % ) ; and mean weight , @ ( @ ) kg and @ ( @ ) kg .
RESULTS	Exenatide QW was statistically noninferior to insulin glargine for the change in HbA ( @c ) from baseline to end point ( least squares mean difference , -@ % [ @ % CI , -@ to -@ ] ; P < @ ) , with the @ % CI upper limit less than the predefined noninferiority margin ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving exenatide QW compared with insulin glargine achieved HbA ( @c ) target levels of @ % ( @ of @ [ @ % ] vs @ of @ [ @ % ] ) or @ % ( @ of @ [ @ % ] vs @ of @ [ @ % ] ) at end point ( P < @ for both ) .
RESULTS	Patient weight was reduced with exenatide QW compared with insulin glargine at end point ( least squares mean difference , -@ kg [ @ % CI , -@ to -@ ] ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Exenatide QW was well tolerated , with a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine but a higher incidence of injection-site induration .
CONCLUSIONS	Exenatide QW was statistically noninferior to insulin glargine for the change in HbA ( @c ) from baseline to end point ; these results suggest that exenatide QW may provide an effective alternative treatment for Japanese patients who require additional therapy to control their diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil plus natural hirudin in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer 's Disease .
METHODS	In the @-week , randomized , open-label and controlled study , @ patients received either donepezil ( @ mg/day for the first @ weeks and @ mg/day thereafter ) or donepezil plus natural hirudin ( @ g/day ) treatment .
METHODS	Efficacy was reflected by the change of the total scores of Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) , Activities of Daily Life ( ADL ) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) .
RESULTS	The patients with the donepezil plus natural hirudin treatment showed more significant improvement in the daily activities and the decline of the cognition than those with donepezil treatment .
RESULTS	Significant difference was present in the groups since the @th week .
RESULTS	No group difference was found in the NPI change .
RESULTS	However , within the hirudin treatment group , more powerful efficacy including NPI assessment was found in the patients with vascular risk factors ( VRF ) as comparing to with those without VRF .
RESULTS	The combination of donepezil and natural hirudin was well tolerated .
RESULTS	The dropout rate was greater in the donepezil and natural hirudin ( @ % ) treatment group than in the donepezil ( @ % ) treatment group .
RESULTS	Similar result was found in the incidence of adverse events ( @ % vs @ % ) , but there was no statistical difference between the two groups .
RESULTS	Adverse events were the most common reason for the dropout .
RESULTS	Although hemorrhage and hypersensitiveness were more common in donepezil plus Maixuekang treatment ( @ % and @ % ) group than in donepezil treatment ( @ % and @ % ) group , no significant difference was present between the two groups .
RESULTS	Economic problem was another important reason for the patients ' withdrawal .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the donepezil treatment in the patients with mild-to-moderate AD , our results suggest that donepezil combined with natural hirudin may improve the treatment effects in the ADL , BPSD and cognition of the patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , this joint treatment is safe .

BACKGROUND	RTOG @ evaluated the potential benefit of zoledronic acid therapy in preventing bone fractures for patients with high grade and/or locally advanced , non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma receiving luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist and radiotherapy ( RT ) .
METHODS	Eligible patients with T-scores of the hip ( < -@ , but > -@ vs > -@ ) and negative bone scans were prospectively randomized to either zoledronic acid , @mg , concurrently with the start of RT and then every six months for a total of @ infusions ( Arm @ ) or observation ( Arm @ ) .
METHODS	Vitamin D and calcium supplements were given to all patients .
METHODS	Secondary objectives included quality of life ( QOL ) and bone mineral density ( BMD ) changes over a period of three years .
RESULTS	Of @ patients accrued before early closure , @ were eligible .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ months for Arm @ and @ months for Arm @ .
RESULTS	Only two patients experienced a bone fracture ( one in each arm ) resulting in no difference in freedom from any bone fracture ( P = @ ) , nor in QOL .
RESULTS	BMD percent changes from baseline to @ months were statistically improved with the use of zoledronic acid compared to observation for the lumbar spine ( @ % vs -@ % , P < @ ) , left total hip ( @ % vs -@ % , P = @ ) , and left femoral neck ( @ % vs -@ % , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with advanced , non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving LHRH agonist and RT , the use of zoledronic acid was associated with statistically improved BMD percent changes .
CONCLUSIONS	The small number of accrued patients resulted in decreased statistical power to detect any differences in the incidence of bone fractures or QOL .

OBJECTIVE	Genetic polymorphism of interleukin ( IL ) -@ and IL-@ receptor antagonist ( IL-@r ) are associated with efficacy of acid suppression , whereas cytochrome P ( CYP ) @C@ polymorphism influences the metabolism of proton pump inhibitor family .
OBJECTIVE	Thus , CYP@C@ and IL-@ polymorphisms may affect the efficacy of H. pylori eradication therapy .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the efficacies of omeprazole and rabeprazole on eradication of H. pylori in relation to CYP@C@ , IL-@B and IL-@RN genotypes in Chinese people .
METHODS	Two hundred and forty Chinese with peptic ulcer disease were randomly assigned to the following regimens : amoxicillin and clarithromycin together with omeprazole ( OAC ) or rabeprazole ( RAC ) .
METHODS	CYP@C@ * @ and * @ , IL@B-@ , IL@B-@ , IL@B + @ and intron @ of the IL-@RN genotypes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism .
RESULTS	The intention-to-treat-based cure rate of the OAC regimen was significantly lower than that of the RAC regimen in the CYP@C@ wild-type homozygotes ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences in the cure rates were observed among the IL-@RN and the IL-@B genotype groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The rabeprazole-based triple regimen was better than the omeprazole in Chinese patients with the CYP@C@ extensive metabolizer genotype .
CONCLUSIONS	The effectiveness of the PPI/AC regimen is unrelated to IL-@B and IL@-RN genetic polymorphism .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the efficacy of lamotrigine or lithium in preventing mood recurrence ( i.e. , a new mood episode ) in bipolar disorder .
METHODS	Data from bipolar I patients with relapses ( i.e. , mood episodes having the same polarity as the index episode within @ or @ days of randomization ) were excluded from post hoc efficacy analyses of two @-month , placebo-controlled maintenance trials of lamotrigine and lithium .
RESULTS	Both lamotrigine and lithium were more effective than placebo in delaying the time to intervention for any mood episode ( depression , mania , hypomania , or mixed ) when relapses that occurred in the first @ days were excluded from the analyses ( p = @ , lamotrigine vs. placebo ; p = @ , lithium vs. placebo ) .
RESULTS	Results were similar when patients with mood episodes within @ days of randomization were excluded .
CONCLUSIONS	Both lamotrigine and lithium maintenance therapy protected against mood episode recurrence in bipolar I disorder .

OBJECTIVE	Pelvic radiotherapy ( RT ) toxicity in the elderly is poorly documented .
OBJECTIVE	We developed a study aiming to evaluate whether or not a limit of age could be identified beyond which toxicities in patients receiving pelvic RT were more frequent or more severe .
METHODS	@ patients with pelvic cancers enrolled in nine EORTC trials , RT arms , were retrospectively studied .
METHODS	Patients were split into six age ranges from @ years to @ years and over .
METHODS	Survivals and late toxicity occurrence were calculated with the Kaplan-Meier method and comparison between age groups with the logrank test .
METHODS	A trend test was done to examine if chronological age had an impact on acute toxicity occurrence .
RESULTS	Survival was comparable in each age group for prostate ( P = @ ) , uterus ( @ ) , anal canal cancer ( P = @ ) and slightly better for the younger group of rectum cancer ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ acute and @ late grade > or = @ were recorded .
RESULTS	Acute nausea / vomiting , skin complications and performance status deterioration were significantly more frequent in younger patients .
RESULTS	There was no trend toward more aged patients to experience diarrhea ( P = @ ) and after adjustment on RT dose , acute urinary complications were observed equally in each age range ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Eighty percent of patients were free of late complication at @ years in each age range ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	For the grade > @ late side-effects , a plateau was observed after @ year at near @ % without any difference ( P = @ ) nor trend ( P = @ ) between age-groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Age per se is not a limiting factor for radical radiotherapy in pelvic malignancies .

BACKGROUND	Depression is a common and distressing mental health problem that is responsible for significant individual disability and cost to society .
BACKGROUND	Medication and psychological therapies are effective for treating depression and maintenance anti-depressants ( m-ADM ) can prevent relapse .
BACKGROUND	However , individuals with depression often express a wish for psychological help that can help them recover from depression in the long-term .
BACKGROUND	We need to develop psychological therapies that prevent depressive relapse/recurrence .
BACKGROUND	A recently developed treatment , Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT , see http://www.mbct.co.uk ) shows potential as a brief group programme for people with recurring depression .
BACKGROUND	In two studies it has been shown to halve the rates of depression recurring compared to usual care.This trial asks the policy research question , is MBCT superior to m-ADM in terms of : a primary outcome of preventing depressive relapse/recurrence over @ months ; and , secondary outcomes of ( a ) depression free days , ( b ) residual depressive symptoms , ( c ) antidepressant ( ADM ) usage , ( d ) psychiatric and medical co-morbidity , ( e ) quality of life , and ( f ) cost effectiveness ?
BACKGROUND	An explanatory research question asks is an increase in mindfulness skills the key mechanism of change ?
METHODS	The design is a single blind , parallel RCT examining MBCT vs. m-ADM with an embedded process study .
METHODS	To answer the main policy research question the proposed trial compares MBCT plus ADM-tapering with m-ADM for patients with recurrent depression .
METHODS	Four hundred and twenty patients with recurrent major depressive disorder in full or partial remission will be recruited through primary care .
METHODS	Depressive relapse/recurrence over two years is the primary outcome variable .
METHODS	The explanatory question will be addressed in two mutually informative ways : quantitative measurement of potential mediating variables pre/post-treatment and a qualitative study of service users ' views and experiences .
CONCLUSIONS	If the results of our exploratory trial are extended to this definitive trial , MBCT will be established as an alternative approach to maintenance anti-depressants for people with a history of recurrent depression .
CONCLUSIONS	The process studies will provide evidence about the effective components which can be used to improve MBCT and inform theory as well as other therapeutic approaches .

BACKGROUND	Iliac artery atherosclerotic disease may cause intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia .
BACKGROUND	It can lead to serious complications such as infection , amputation and even death .
BACKGROUND	Revascularization relieves symptoms and prevents these complications .
BACKGROUND	Historically , open surgical repair , in the form of endarterectomy or bypass , was used .
BACKGROUND	Over the last decade , endovascular repair has become the first choice of treatment for iliac arterial occlusive disease .
BACKGROUND	No definitive consensus has emerged about the best endovascular strategy and which type of stent , if any , to use .
BACKGROUND	However , in more advanced disease , that is , long or multiple stenoses or occlusions , literature is most supportive of primary stenting with a balloon-expandable stent in the common iliac artery ( Jongkind V et al. , J Vasc Surg @:@ -@,@ ) .
BACKGROUND	Recently , a PTFE-covered balloon-expandable stent ( Advanta V@ , Atrium Medical Inc. , Hudson , NH , USA ) has been introduced for the iliac artery .
BACKGROUND	Covering stents with PTFE has been shown to lead to less neo-intimal hyperplasia and this might lower restenosis rates ( Dolmatch B et al. .
BACKGROUND	J Vasc Interv Radiol @:@ -@,@ , Marin ML et al. .
BACKGROUND	J Vasc Interv Radiol @:@ -@,@ , Virmani R et al. .
BACKGROUND	J Vasc Interv Radiol @:@ -@,@ ) .
BACKGROUND	However , only one RCT , of mediocre quality has been published on this stent in the common iliac artery ( Mwipatayi BP et al. .
BACKGROUND	J Vasc Surg @:@ -@,@ , Bekken JA et al. .
BACKGROUND	J Vasc Surg @:@ -@,@ ) .
BACKGROUND	Our hypothesis is that covered balloon-expandable stents lead to better results when compared to uncovered balloon-expandable stents .
METHODS	This is a prospective , randomized , controlled , double-blind , multi-center trial .
METHODS	The study population consists of human volunteers aged over @ years , with symptomatic advanced atherosclerotic disease of the common iliac artery , defined as stenoses longer than @ cm and occlusions .
METHODS	A total of @ patients will be included .
METHODS	The control group will undergo endovascular dilatation or revascularization of the common iliac artery , followed by placement of one or more uncovered balloon-expandable stents .
METHODS	The study group will undergo the same treatment , however one or more PTFE-covered balloon-expandable stents will be placed .
METHODS	When necessary , the aorta , external iliac artery , common femoral artery , superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery will be treated , using the standard treatment .
METHODS	The primary endpoint is absence of binary restenosis rate .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints are reocclusion rate , target-lesion revascularization rate , clinical success , procedural success , hemodynamic success , major amputation rate , complication rate and mortality rate .
METHODS	Main study parameters are age , gender , relevant co-morbidity , and several patient , disease and procedure-related parameters .

OBJECTIVE	To analyze influence of pre-operative MRCP on the management of patients with gall stones .
METHODS	This prospective randomized study was carried on @ patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy within @ years .
METHODS	In group I , pre-operative MRCP was performed in @ patients with age range of @-@ years .
METHODS	Group II included @ patients managed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy without doing pre-operative MRCP with age range of @-@ years .
RESULTS	In group I ; pre-operative MRCP screening revealed clinically silent CBD stones in @ patients ( @ % ) , accessory cystic duct in @ ( @ % ) , abnormal insertion of cystic duct in @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Postoperatively , bile duct injury was inflected in @ patient in group I. On the other hand , there were @ patients with bile duct injury and @ patients with residual stones in group II .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant increase of post-operative complications in group II ( p < or = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	MRCP is diagnostically useful in management of patients with gall stones prior to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and its routine use can reduce the incidence of post-operative complications .

###21499192
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of preoperative intravitreal injection of bevacizumab on surgery and on the early postoperative course in diabetic patients undergoing vitrectomy for dense vitreous hemorrhage .
METHODS	Thirty-five patients with dense diabetic vitreous hemorrhage were randomly assigned to a group that received @ mg of intravitreal bevacizumab @ week before vitrectomy ( @ patients ) or the control group ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	To compare the complexity of two groups , intraoperative complexity score and proliferative diabetic vitreoretinopathy stage were recorded .
METHODS	Intraoperative bleeding , break formation , number of endodiathermy applications , best-corrected visual acuity , anatomical outcome at Month @ and at final follow-up , and postoperative complications were evaluated .
RESULTS	Mean complexity scores and proliferative diabetic vitreoretinopathy stages of both groups were similar .
RESULTS	The mean score of bleeding was @ in the injection group versus @ in the control group ( P = @ ) ; endodiathermy applications and break formations were @ versus @ ( P = @ ) and @ versus @ ( P = @ ) in the injection and control groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Anatomical outcome and visual acuity at Month @ and at the final follow-up were similar .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that intravitreal injection of bevacizumab before vitrectomy for dense diabetic vitreous hemorrhage has no significant effect on facilitation of surgery or on the early postoperative course .

###23463651
BACKGROUND	Type @ diabetes ( T@D ) has features of disordered lipid and glucose metabolism , due in part to reduced mitochondrial content .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to investigate effects of different types of exercise on mitochondrial content and substrate oxidation in individuals with T@D ( ancillary study of the randomized controlled trial Health Benefits of Aerobic and Resistance Training in Individuals with Type @ Diabetes , HART-D ) .
METHODS	T@D individuals were randomized to aerobic training ( AT , n = @ ) , resistance training ( RT , n = @ ) , combination training ( ATRT , n = @ ) , or nonexercise control ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Blood draws , peak oxygen consumption tests , dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans and muscle biopsies of vastus lateralis were performed before and after @ months .
METHODS	Ex vivo substrate oxidations ( ( @ ) CO@ ) , mitochondrial content , and enzyme activities were measured .
METHODS	Glycated hemoglobin A@c and free fatty acids were also determined .
RESULTS	Mitochondrial content increased after RT and ATRT .
RESULTS	Octanoate oxidation increased after AT and ATRT , whereas palmitate , pyruvate , and acetate oxidations increased in all exercise groups .
RESULTS	Exercise-induced responses in mitochondrial DNA were associated with improvements in peak oxygen consumption , - hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity , and palmitate oxidation .
CONCLUSIONS	Nine months of AT and RT significantly improved most aspects of skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and substrate oxidation , whereas the combination improved all aspects .
CONCLUSIONS	These exercise responses were associated with clinical improvements , indicating that long-term training , especially combination , is an effective lifestyle therapy for individuals with T@D by way of improving muscle substrate metabolism .

OBJECTIVE	Pilot study examining the effects of estrogen therapy ( ET ) on antidepressant response in postmenopausal women with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) .
METHODS	Twenty-two subjects received sertraline at @mg/day for one week , with an increase to @mg/day at week @ for a @-week trial .
METHODS	Transdermal estrogen or placebo patches @ mg were randomly administered concurrent with the initiation of sertraline treatment .
METHODS	The @ item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-@ ) was administered to all patients at baseline and weekly thereafter .
RESULTS	Both groups showed a similar significant reduction in HDRS-@ scores by the end of the study .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups at the end of the @-week trial , but the women receiving sertraline with ET showed significantly greater early improvement ( weeks @-@ ) compared to the women receiving sertraline with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Sertraline is an effective antidepressant for postmenopausal women with MDD .
CONCLUSIONS	ET does not alter the response rate to antidepressant therapy however ET may play a role in accelerating the antidepressant response .

OBJECTIVE	The authors tested the hypothesis that nortriptyline and interpersonal psychotherapy , alone and in combination , are superior to placebo in achieving remission of bereavement-related major depressive episodes .
METHODS	Eighty subjects , aged @ years and older , with major depressive episodes that began within @ months before or @ months after the loss of a spouse or significant other were randomly assigned to a @-week doubleblind trial of one of four treatment conditions : nortriptyline plus interpersonal psychotherapy ( N = @ ) , nortriptyline alone in a medication clinic ( N = @ ) , placebo plus interpersonal psychotherapy ( N = @ ) , or placebo alone in a medication clinic ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	The protocol required that the acute-phase double-blind treatment be ended after @ weeks if Hamilton depression scale ratings had not improved by @ % .
METHODS	Remission was defined as a @-item Hamilton scale score of @ or lower for @ consecutive weeks .
RESULTS	The rate of remission for nortriptyline plus interpersonal psychotherapy was @ % ( N = @ ) ; for medication clinic , nortriptyline , @ % ( N = @ ) ; for placebo plus interpersonal psychotherapy , @ % ( N = @ ) ; and for medication clinic , placebo , @ % ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	In a generalized logit model , there was a significant effect of nortriptyline over placebo but no interpersonal psychotherapy effect and no nortriptyline-by-interpersonal psychotherapy interaction .
RESULTS	Rates of all-cause attrition were lowest in the nortriptyline plus interpersonal psychotherapy group .
CONCLUSIONS	Nortriptyline was superior to placebo in achieving remission of bereavement-related major depressive episodes .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of medication and psychotherapy was associated with the highest rate of treatment completion .
CONCLUSIONS	These results support the use of pharmacologic treatment of major depressive episodes in the wake of a serious life stressor such as bereavement .

###17575270
OBJECTIVE	Major bleeding after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) is an independent risk factor for early and late mortality .
OBJECTIVE	We developed and validated a risk score predictive of major bleeding after PCI using the femoral approach .
RESULTS	Baseline clinical and procedural variables from two contemporary , multicentre , randomized PCI trials were used for risk score development ( the REPLACE-@ trial , n = @ ) and validation ( the REPLACE-@ trial , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	On the basis of the odds ratio , independent risk factors were assigned a weighted integer , the sum of which comprised a total risk score .
RESULTS	Seven variables were identified as independent correlates of major bleeding ( age > @ years , female gender , estimated glomerular filtration rate < @ mL/min/@ @ m ( @ ) , pre-existing anaemia , administration of low-molecular-weight heparin within @ h pre-PCI , use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors , and intraaortic balloon pump use ) .
RESULTS	In the development set , the risk of major bleeding varied from @ % in patients without risk factors to @ % in high-risk patients .
RESULTS	The discriminatory power of this risk model was confirmed in the validation data set ( area under the receiver operating curve = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A simple risk score of baseline clinical and procedural variables is useful to predict the incidence of major peri-procedural bleeding after contemporary PCI using the femoral approach .

CONCLUSIONS	Female sexual dysfunction and tape exposure may be higher with a transobturator tape .

###10657405
OBJECTIVE	Some stroke patients and their families express reservations about participating in trials of experimental therapies for acute stroke .
OBJECTIVE	Among many reasons given for this is the concern that by participating , patients may be deprived of some component of routine care .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine the effect on outcome of participating in a clinical stroke trial while being treated with placebo .
METHODS	Prospective clinical information was collected for all patients admitted with acute ischemic stroke between July @ and July @ .
METHODS	A subgroup of these patients was enrolled in a clinical trial of acute stroke therapy and had been randomly assigned to the placebo group .
METHODS	The control group was selected from concurrent stroke patients who were not enrolled in any clinical trial .
METHODS	The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) was performed on admission and on day @ after admission .
METHODS	The Glasgow Outcome Scale ( GOS ) was also performed at discharge .
METHODS	Stroke severity was classified as `` severe '' if NIHSS was > / = @ or GOS > / = @ .
METHODS	Group comparisons were performed with chi ( @ ) tests .
RESULTS	One hundred twenty-six patients were evaluated .
RESULTS	Forty-seven were placebo patients , and @ were selected as control subjects .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to age , sex , hematocrit , blood glucose level , history of hypertension , diabetes , smoking , or initial NIHSS .
RESULTS	In addition , there was no difference between groups in terms of the frequency of baseline stroke subtype .
RESULTS	Among our controls , @ patients ( @ % ) were on antithrombotic treatment during hospitalization , whereas none of our placebo patients were on any antithrombotic treatment .
RESULTS	For the GOS at follow-up , a good outcome was attained by @ % of the control subjects and @ % of placebo patients ( not significant ) .
RESULTS	A severe NIHSS ( > @ ) at follow-up , however , was documented in @ % of controls and @ % of placebo patients ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a trend toward a higher ( `` worse '' ) mean follow-up NIHSS among placebo patients ( mean NIHSS , @ ) versus controls ( mean NIHSS , @ ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients enrolled in the placebo arms of some acute clinical stroke trials have similar functional outcomes but more severe neurological deficits at @ week than did a control group .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings might be partially explained by the withholding of antithrombotic medication and the exclusion criteria inherent in most trials .
CONCLUSIONS	Vigilance is required to ensure that all patients participating in stroke studies be guaranteed optimal known medical therapy .

BACKGROUND	Thoracic endovascular aortic repair ( TEVAR ) represents a therapeutic concept for type B aortic dissection .
BACKGROUND	Long-term outcomes and morphology after TEVAR for uncomplicated dissection are unknown .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients with stable type B aortic dissection previously randomized to optimal medical treatment and TEVAR ( n = @ ) versus optimal medical treatment alone ( n = @ ) were analyzed retrospectively for aorta-specific , all-cause outcomes , and disease progression using landmark statistical analysis of years @ to @ after index procedure .
RESULTS	Cox regression was used to compare outcomes between groups ; all analyses are based on intention to treat .
RESULTS	The risk of all-cause mortality ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , aorta-specific mortality ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , and progression ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) after @ years was lower with TEVAR than with optimal medical treatment alone .
RESULTS	Landmark analysis suggested a benefit of TEVAR for all end points between @ and @ years ; for example , for all-cause mortality ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , aorta-specific mortality ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , and for progression ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) ; Landmarking at @ year and @ month revealed consistent findings .
RESULTS	Both improved survival and less progression of disease at @ years after elective TEVAR were associated with stent graft induced false lumen thrombosis in @ % of cases ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study of survivors of type B aortic dissection , TEVAR in addition to optimal medical treatment is associated with improved @-year aorta-specific survival and delayed disease progression .
CONCLUSIONS	In stable type B dissection with suitable anatomy , preemptive TEVAR should be considered to improve late outcome .

BACKGROUND	The quality of parent-child communications about sex and sexuality appears to be a strong determinant of adolescents ' sexual behavior .
BACKGROUND	Evaluations of interventions aimed at improving such communications can help identify strategies for preventing early onset of sexual behavior .
METHODS	A school-based abstinence-only curriculum was implemented among @ middle school students , who were randomly assigned to receive either the classroom instruction alone or the classroom instruction enhanced by five homework assignments designed to be completed by the students and their parents .
METHODS	An experimental design involving pretest and posttest surveys was used to assess the relative efficacy of the curriculum delivered with and without the parent-child homework assignments .
RESULTS	In analyses of covariance controlling for baseline scores , immediately after the intervention , adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum reported greater self-efficacy for refusing high-risk behaviors than did those who received the classroom instruction only ( mean scores , @ vs. @ ) .
RESULTS	They also reported less intention to have sex before finishing high school ( @ vs. @ ) , and more frequent parent-child communications about prevention ( @ vs. @ ) and sexual consequences ( @ vs. @ ) .
RESULTS	In all significant comparisons , the direction of the findings favored adolescents who received the enhanced curriculum .
RESULTS	Dose-response relationships supported the findings .
CONCLUSIONS	Parent-child homework assignments designed to reinforce and support school-based prevention curricula can have an immediate impact on several key determinants of sexual behavior among middle school adolescents .

###12651035
OBJECTIVE	We sought to assess the relationship between the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) myocardial perfusion ( TMP ) grade and myocardial salvage as well as the usefulness of TMP grade in comparing two different reperfusion strategies .
BACKGROUND	The angiographic index of TMP grade correlates with infarct size and mortality after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) .
BACKGROUND	Its relationship to myocardial salvage and its usefulness in comparing different reperfusion strategies are not known .
METHODS	We analyzed the TMP grade on angiograms obtained at one to two weeks after treatment in @ patients enrolled in two randomized trials that compared stenting with thrombolysis in AMI .
METHODS	Patients were classified into two groups : @ patients with TMP grade @/@ and @ patients with TMP grade @/@ .
METHODS	Two scintigraphic studies were performed : before and one to two weeks after reperfusion .
METHODS	The salvage index was calculated as the proportion of the area at risk salvaged by reperfusion .
RESULTS	Patients with TMP grade @/@ had a higher salvage index ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ , p = @ ) , a smaller final infarct size ( @ + / - @ % vs. @ + / - @ % of the left ventricle , p = @ ) , and a trend toward lower one-year mortality ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) than patients with TMP grade @/@ .
RESULTS	The relationship between TMP and salvage index was independent of the form of reperfusion therapy .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with TMP grade @/@ was significantly higher after stenting than after thrombolysis ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings show that the TMP grade is a useful marker of the degree of myocardial salvage achieved with reperfusion and a sensitive indicator of the efficacy of reperfusion strategies in patients with AMI .

OBJECTIVE	The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate comparative trough effects of formoterol and salmeterol on beta@-adrenoceptor regulation and bronchodilator response after regular twice-daily treatment , with a secondary aim to evaluate any possible association with beta@-adrenoceptor polymorphism .
METHODS	Sixteen asthmatic subjects , with mean ( SD ) age @ ( @ ) years , all taking inhaled corticosteroids and with a forced expiratory volume in @ s ( FEV@ ) of @ ( @ ) % predicted were recruited to take part in a randomised single-blind , three-way cross-over study .
METHODS	The subjects received three treatments each for @ week , with @-week washout periods in between : ( @ ) formoterol dry powder , @ microg twice daily , ( @ ) salmeterol dry powder , @ microg twice daily , or ( @ ) placebo , twice daily .
METHODS	Spirometry and lymphocyte beta@-adrenoceptor parameters were measured before the first dose and @ h after the last dose of each treatment , as well as domiciliary peak flow during each treatment .
RESULTS	There were no differences in beta@-adrenoceptor density ( Bmax ) between the three treatments prior to the first dose ; whereas , after the last dose , Bmax was lower with both active treatments than with placebo , but was significant for salmeterol only -- a @-fold geometric mean fold difference ( @ % CI @ - to @-fold ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , there were n = @ of @ subjects with salmeterol and n = @ of @ with formoterol who had a greater than @ % fall in Bmax .
RESULTS	Post-hoc trend analysis of polymorphism showed that the propensity for downregulation appeared to be related to the occurrence of an allelic substitution of glycine at codon @-@ of @ for salmeterol versus @ of @ for formoterol with a greater than @ % fall compared with placebo .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between salmeterol and formoterol in terms of mean or individual values for downregulation .
RESULTS	There was evidence of persistent bronchodilator activity with both active treatments compared with placebo ; this was significant for forced expiratory flow rate between @ % and @ % of vital capacity ( FEF@-@ ) -- the mean difference versus salmeterol was @ @/s ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , P = @ , and versus formoterol was @ @/s ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	These effects were mirrored by significant improvements in morning peak flow rate compared with placebo -- mean difference versus salmeterol was @ @/min ( @ % CI @-@ ) , P = @ , and versus formoterol was @ @/min ( @ % CI @-@ ) , P < @ .
CONCLUSIONS	There were no differences between regular treatment with formoterol and salmeterol in their effects on lymphocyte beta@-adrenoceptor regulation at the end of a @-h dosing interval , with both drugs exhibiting a residual degree of bronchodilator activity at the same time point .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies to evaluate receptor regulation and bronchodilator response are required in susceptible patients who have the homozygous glycine-@ polymorphism .

OBJECTIVE	Poor nutrition is a common complication of strokes severe enough to require inpatient rehabilitation .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore tested whether intensive nutritional supplements given to undernourished patients from the time of their admission to a specialized stroke rehabilitation service would improve patient outcomes .
METHODS	Randomized , prospective , double-blind , single center study comparing intensive nutritional supplementation to routine nutritional supplementation in @ undernourished patients admitted to a stroke service .
METHODS	The analysis included the @ % of patients who were not lost to follow-up due to acute or subacute hospitalization ( n = @ ; @ in each group ) .
METHODS	The nutritional supplements are commercially available and Food and Drug Administration approved .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable was change in total score on the Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) .
METHODS	The secondary outcome measurements included the FIM motor and cognitive subscores , length of stay ( taken from day of admission ) , @-minute and @-minute timed walk tests measured at admission and on discharge , and discharge disposition ( home/not home ) .
RESULTS	Patients receiving intensive nutritional supplementation improved more than those on standard nutritional supplements on measures of motor function ( total FIM , FIM motor subscore , @-minute and @-minute timed walk tests , all significant at p < @ ) .
RESULTS	They did not , however , improve on measures of cognition ( FIM cognition score ) .
RESULTS	A higher proportion of patients who received the intensive nutritional supplementation went home compared to those on standard supplementation ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intensive nutritional supplementation , using readily available commercial preparations , improves motor recovery in previously undernourished patients receiving intensive in-patient rehabilitation after stroke .

OBJECTIVE	Histaminergic H@ antagonists have been reported to provoke central nervous system dysfunction in humans .
OBJECTIVE	They also aggravate ischemic neuronal damage in experimental animals .
OBJECTIVE	Because energy failure and glutamate release are crucial factors in ischemic neuronal damage , the effects of ranitidine on energy state and the extracellular concentration of glutamate were investigated in gerbil brain .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized , controlled animal study .
METHODS	University animal laboratory .
METHODS	Male Mongolian gerbils .
METHODS	The changes in the direct-current potential shift in the hippocampal CA@ area produced by transient forebrain ischemia for @ mins were compared in gerbils pretreated with saline or ranitidine ( @ nmol ) intracerebroventricularly .
METHODS	The histologic outcome was evaluated @ days after ischemia by observing the delayed neuronal death in these animals .
METHODS	In a second study , brain concentrations of adenosine @ ' - triphosphate after various durations of decapitation ischemia were determined , and the effect of ranitidine was evaluated .
METHODS	In a third experiment , changes in the extracellular concentrations of excitatory amino acids during forebrain ischemia were examined by a microdialysis procedure .
RESULTS	The forebrain ischemia produced a sudden shift in the membrane potential @ + / - @ secs ( mean + / - sd , n = @ ) after the start of ischemia .
RESULTS	The preischemic administration of ranitidine facilitated onset of depolarization ( @ + / - @ secs ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The histologic outcome was aggravated by ranitidine ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Decapitation ischemia reduced brain adenosine @ ' - triphosphate concentration rapidly .
RESULTS	Ranitidine facilitated the ischemic reduction in adenosine @ ' - triphosphate , and the value after @ min was @ % of that in the corresponding saline group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Ranitidine enhanced the ischemic increase in the glutamate concentration , and the peak value in the ranitidine group was @ % of that in the saline group ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The deleterious effect of ranitidine on ischemic neuronal damage may involve the increase in the extracellular concentration of glutamate and facilitation of energy depletion in an anaerobic state .

BACKGROUND	An integrated approach to dementia is generally recommended because no one discipline is adequately equipped it deal with the complex psychic , physical and social problems that are inherent in dementia .
BACKGROUND	A multidisciplinary approach , however , leads inevitably to higher costs .
BACKGROUND	It is not known what the cost/benefit ratio will be .
OBJECTIVE	To describe our research into the costs and benefits of an integrated approach to dementia involving the use of a diagnostic research centre for psycho-geriatrics and thereafter to compare our findings with the results of other studies of the costs and benefits of an integrated approach .
METHODS	We performed a prospective and randomised efficiency study and we compared our findings with the results of other studies of the costs and benefits of an integrated approach .
METHODS	We reviewed recent literature .
RESULTS	The DRC-PG was more effective than normal care as far as the patients ' quality of life was concerned , but was not more expensive .
RESULTS	It can therefore be regarded as a cost-effective facility for ambulatory patients with dementia .
RESULTS	Three other studies provided additional empirical evidence of the success of a similar integrated approach in various sectors involved in the care of patients with dementia .
CONCLUSIONS	An integrated approach with regard to the diagnosis , treatment and management of dementia produces favourable results .
CONCLUSIONS	More research is needed into the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of integrated care programmes .
CONCLUSIONS	This should result in improvements in the care and treatment of patients with dementia .

BACKGROUND	Type @ diabetes patients on premixed insulin are commonly prescribed biphasic insulin with low prandial insulin content , such as biphasic insulin aspart ( BIAsp ) @ , comprising @ % insulin aspart ( IAsp ) .
BACKGROUND	The new formulations BIAsp @ and BIAsp @ contain @ % and @ % soluble IAsp , respectively .
BACKGROUND	We compared the pharmacodynamics ( PD ) and pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of BIAsp @ , @ , and @ and IAsp in a glucose clamp trial .
METHODS	In this randomized , double-blind , crossover study at a clinical research institute , @ type @ diabetes patients on basal-bolus therapy each underwent four glucose clamps ( clamp level @ mmol/L , duration @ h post-dosing [ @ h for IAsp ] ) and received a single dose of @ U/kg BIAsp @ , @ , or @ and IAsp .
METHODS	Main PD/PK outcome parameters measured were early - and late-phase glucose disposal ( area under the curve of glucose infusion rate [ AUC ( GIR ) ] ) , nonesterified fatty acid concentrations , and IAsp concentrations .
RESULTS	With increasing proportions of soluble IAsp , the insulin formulations showed significantly higher early metabolic activity ( ratio of AUC ( GIR ) @-@ h : BIAsp @/BIAsp @ = @ [ P < @ ] , BIAsp @/BIAsp @ = @ [ P < @ ) , IAsp/BIAsp @ = @ [ P < @ ] ) and lower late metabolic activity ( ratio of AUC ( GIR ) @-@ h : BIAsp @/BIAsp @ = @ [ P < @ ] , BIAsp @/BIAsp @ = @ [ P < @ ] ) .
RESULTS	Likewise , early IAsp levels were significantly greater and late PK concentrations were significantly lower with increasing proportion of soluble IAsp .
CONCLUSIONS	There are significant differences between the early and late PD and PK effects among BIAsp @ , @ , and @ and IAsp that should allow tailored treatment with the convenience of prandial and basal insulin in each injection .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safety of using intradermal absorbable sutures for pilonidal sinus skin closure .
METHODS	The study was prospectively carried out in @ patients randomized into two groups of patients .
METHODS	In the first group ( @ patients ) , interrupted sutures were used ; in the second group ( @ patients ) , a continuous intradermal suture was used .
METHODS	We have analyzed the time off work , time to walk without pain , time to sit on the toilet without pain , wound infections , satisfaction rate and esthetic results .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to the time off work , time to walk without pain and time to sit on a toilet without pain .
RESULTS	There was also no significant difference between the groups with regard to the wound infection rates ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The study suggested that the patients satisfaction was higher when an intradermal suture was used ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , a better cosmetic appearance of the scar was obtained with an intradermal suture ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that using intradermal sutures after excision and primary closure of the pilonidal sinus is safe and has advantages in terms of the cosmetic results and patient satisfaction .

BACKGROUND	Patients with medically unexplained or functional somatic symptoms ( FSS ) are prevalent in primary care .
BACKGROUND	In this pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial we aimed to test the effect of a training programme ( The Extended Reattribution and Management model ) for general practitioners ( GPs ) in the treatment of FSS .
METHODS	@ participating GPs were randomised to the control group or the training group .
METHODS	The GPs included consecutive @ - to @-year-old patients presenting during a @-week period for new health complaints .
METHODS	We assessed a stratified subsample with the psychiatric interview Schedules of Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry .
METHODS	Of @ patients interviewed , @ fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for any ICD-@ somatoform disorder ( SD ) and @ presented FSS without fulfilling these criteria ( sub-threshold SD ) .
METHODS	Patients completed questionnaires at baseline and after @ , @ and @ months .
METHODS	The questionnaires included assessment of health status ( @-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form ; SF-@ ) , health anxiety ( Whiteley-@ ) and physical symptoms ( Symptom Check List-@ , somatization subscale ) .
RESULTS	Patients with SD consulting trained GPs improved more on our primary outcome of physical functioning than patients consulting control GPs at the @-month follow-up ( p = @ ) , but the improvement was not statistically significant at later follow-up .
RESULTS	We found no significant differences in improvement between patients with SD and those with sub-threshold SD .
RESULTS	Results for other SF-@ subscales , physical symptoms and health anxiety only showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups for patients with SD ; patients consulting trained GPs had less improvement in vitality , health anxiety and physical symptoms at @ months compared with the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	GP training may accelerate improvement in physical functioning for patients with SD .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the effect is small and may not be clinically significant .

BACKGROUND	We investigated whether individualized positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) improves oxygenation , ventilation , and lung mechanics during one-lung ventilation compared with standardized PEEP .
METHODS	Thirty patients undergoing thoracic surgery were randomly allocated to the study or control group .
METHODS	Both groups received an alveolar recruitment maneuver at the beginning and end of one-lung ventilation .
METHODS	After the alveolar recruitment maneuver , the control group had their lungs ventilated with a @ cmH@O PEEP , while the study group had their lungs ventilated with an individualized PEEP level determined by a PEEP decrement trial .
METHODS	Arterial blood samples , lung mechanics , and volumetric capnography were recorded at multiple timepoints throughout the procedure .
RESULTS	The individualized PEEP values in study group were higher than the standardized PEEP values ( @ @ vs @ cmH@O ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In both groups , arterial oxygenation decreased when bilateral-lung ventilation was switched to one-lung ventilation and increased after the alveolar recruitment maneuver .
RESULTS	During one-lung ventilation , oxygenation was maintained in the study group but decreased in the control group .
RESULTS	After one-lung ventilation , arterial oxygenation was significantly higher in the study group ( @ vs @ mmHg , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Static compliance decreased in both groups when bilateral-lung ventilation was switched to one-lung ventilation .
RESULTS	Static compliance increased significantly only in the study group ( P < @ ) after the alveolar recruitment maneuver and optimal PEEP adjustment .
RESULTS	The alveolar recruitment maneuver did not decrease cardiac index in any patient .
CONCLUSIONS	During one-lung ventilation , the improvements in oxygenation and lung mechanics after an alveolar recruitment maneuver were better preserved by ventilation by using individualized PEEP with a PEEP decrement trial than with a standardized @ cmH@O of PEEP .

BACKGROUND	Few effective treatments exist for patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma not responding to treatment with bortezomib and lenalidomide .
BACKGROUND	Pomalidomide alone has shown limited efficacy in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma , but synergistic effects have been noted when combined with dexamethasone .
BACKGROUND	We compared the efficacy and safety of pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone with high-dose dexamethasone alone in these patients .
METHODS	This multicentre , open-label , randomised phase @ trial was undertaken in Australia , Canada , Europe , Russia , and the USA .
METHODS	Patients were eligible if they had been diagnosed with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma , and had failed at least two previous treatments of bortezomib and lenalidomide .
METHODS	They were assigned in a @:@ ratio with a validated interactive voice and internet response system to either @ day cycles of pomalidomide ( @ mg/day on days @-@ , orally ) plus low-dose dexamethasone ( @ mg/day on days @ , @ , @ , and @ , orally ) or high-dose dexamethasone ( @ mg/day on days @-@ , @-@ , and @-@ , orally ) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity .
METHODS	Stratification factors were age ( @ years vs > @ years ) , disease population ( refractory vs relapsed and refractory vs bortezomib intolerant ) , and number of previous treatments ( two vs more than two ) .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( PFS ) .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ , and with EudraCT , number @-@-@ .
RESULTS	The accrual for the study has been completed and the analyses are presented .
RESULTS	@ patients were randomly assigned to receive pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and @ high-dose dexamethasone .
RESULTS	After a median follow-up of @ months ( IQR @-@ ) , median PFS with pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) versus @ months ( @-@ ) with high-dose dexamethasone ( hazard ratio @ [ @ % CI @-@ ] ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The most common grade @-@ haematological adverse events in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethasone groups were neutropenia ( @ [ @ % ] of @ vs @ [ @ % ] of @ , respectively ) , anaemia ( @ [ @ % ] vs @ [ @ % ] , respectively ) , and thrombocytopenia ( @ [ @ % ] vs @ [ @ % ] , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Grade @-@ non-haematological adverse events in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone and high-dose dexamethasone groups included pneumonia ( @ [ @ % ] vs @ [ @ % ] , respectively ) , bone pain ( @ [ @ % ] vs seven [ @ % ] , respectively ) , and fatigue ( @ [ @ % ] vs nine [ @ % ] , respectively ) .
RESULTS	There were @ ( @ % ) treatment-related adverse events leading to death in the pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone group and seven ( @ % ) in the high-dose dexamethasone group .
CONCLUSIONS	Pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone , an oral regimen , could be considered a new treatment option in patients with refractory or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma .

OBJECTIVE	The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of risedronate use in postmenopausal woman by measuring its effects on urinary crosslinked C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen ( CTx ) , a biochemical marker of bone resorption .
METHODS	One hundred osteoporotic ( control and treatment ) and @ osteopenic ( control and treatment ) postmenopausal women , selected according to World Health Organization criteria , were included in the study .
METHODS	The treatment groups ( osteopenic and osteoporotic ) were given risedronate @ mg once a week .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was mean percentage change in CTx from baseline to @ months .
METHODS	The secondary endpoints included evaluation of the incidence of clinical or laboratory adverse events occurring during the @-month study period .
METHODS	The least significant change ( LSC ) , calculated from the within-subject variability in the two control groups , was used to define response .
RESULTS	Of the @ women enrolled , @ ( @ % ) completed the study .
RESULTS	After @ months , urinary CTx levels were -@ % ( range -@ % to -@ % ) below baseline in the osteoporotic treatment group and -@ % ( range -@ % to -@ % ) below baseline in the osteopenic treatment group .
RESULTS	Analysis of LSC showed that @ % of risedronate treatment groups were categorized as responders after @ months of treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The study shows that osteoporotic and osteopenic women on risedronate treatment have statistically significant suppressed bone turnover and CTx can be useful to confirm this observation .
CONCLUSIONS	The low withdrawal rate and adverse effects rate show that risedronate was well tolerated by the study population .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether routine pre-intubation positive pressure mask ventilation ( PPMV ) influences the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) .
METHODS	Prospective , randomised single blinded study .
METHODS	@ ASA class I-III patients of either sex ( number calculated as follows : incidence of PONV = @ % , group difference = @ % , a-error < @ % , statistical power = @ % ) scheduled for elective surgery ( no eye , neck , nose or ear surgery ) of at least @ min duration .
METHODS	Approval by the local ethical committee and informed written consent was obtained .
METHODS	After preoxygenation ( @ min ) and induction of anesthesia with fentanyl ( @-@ micrograms.kg-@ b.w. ) and thiopental ( @ mg.kg-@ b.w ) patients were divided into two groups : group @ patients ( without PPMV , n = @ ) received succinylcholine @s after thiopental followed by tracheal intubation .
METHODS	Group @ patients ( with PPMV , n = @ ) were ventilated by mask for at least @s after thiopental injection , followed by succinylcholine and , after another @s of PPMV , tracheal intubation .
METHODS	All anesthetics were performed by @ anesthesiologists ( @ certified staff members , @ residents ) .
METHODS	Primary endpoint : incidence of PONV during the first @ h postoperatively .
METHODS	Secondary end point : relation between PONV and medical qualification of the anesthesiologists .
OBJECTIVE	significant difference in PONV between groups .
METHODS	contingency tables with chi-square and Fisher 's exact test , Kruskal-Wallis-test ( for categorical variables ) ; ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe ( for continuous variables ) , p < @ .
RESULTS	No difference was found in the incidence of nausea ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) or vomiting ( @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ) regardless whether the patients received PPMV or not .
RESULTS	Women were nearly three times more likely to suffer from PONV ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Distribution of age , weight , height , anesthetic duration and surgical procedures were comparable between groups .
RESULTS	The degree of medical qualification did not influence the incidence of PONV ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Since neither routine pre-intubation positive pressure mask ventilation nor the medical qualification of the anesthesilogist affect the incidence of PONV neither variable needs to be taken into account in studies concerning PONV .

BACKGROUND	While the addition of targeted therapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NACT ) dramatically increases the rate of pathological complete response in HER@-positive breast cancer , no reduction in the rate of mastectomy has been observed in randomised studies .
METHODS	A retrospective single centre analysis of all patients treated with anti HER@-based NACT for T@-@ breast cancer , focusing on patients treated with mastectomy .
RESULTS	Among @ patients treated between June @ and July @ , surgery was performed immediately post-NACT in @ cases ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Breast-conserving surgery could be performed for @ of the patients ( @ % ) , with a @-year local relapse-free survival of @ % .
RESULTS	A mastectomy was performed in two cases following patients ' wishes and in @ cases based on pre-NACT findings ( n = @ ) or post-NACT outcomes ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	For @ out of the @ cases , a good pathological response was observed , and multidisciplinary reanalysis suggests that breast-conserving surgery outright may have been sufficient for @ patients .
RESULTS	Finally , a salvage mastectomy based on post-lumpectomy pathological results was decided in five cases ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The @-year metastasis-free survival was @ % for all patients operated on after NACT ( n = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the good efficacy of anti HER@-based NACT , breast-conserving surgery should be standard practice for most patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Total mastectomy on the other hand should be restricted to a few patients , mainly those with positive margins on the lumpectomy specimen .

BACKGROUND	There is not univocal concordance for using high-dose sequential therapy ( HDS ) as first-line treatment for aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) .
BACKGROUND	We designed this study to evaluate the usefulness of HDS followed by high-dose therapy ( HDT ) with autologous stem cell transplantation as front-line treatment in different subsets of aggressive NHL .
METHODS	Among @ patients aged @-@ years with aggressive , advanced stage NHL , @ patients were randomized to VACOP-B ( etoposide , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone , bleomycin ) for @ weeks ( plus HDS/HDT in case of persistent disease ) ( arm A ) , and @ patients to VACOP-B for @ weeks plus upfront HDS/HDT ( arm B ) .
RESULTS	According to the intention-to-treat analysis , the complete response rate was @ % for arm A and @ % for arm B. With a median follow-up of @ months there was no difference in @-year probability of survival ( @ % and @ % ; P = @ ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) ( @ % and @ % ; P = @ ) and progression-free survival ( PFS ) ( @ % and @ % ; P = @ ) between the two arms .
RESULTS	Subgroup analyses confirmed that the best results in terms of survival , DFS and PFS were achieved by patients with large B-cell NHL without bone marrow ( BM ) involvement , independently of the treatment arm .
RESULTS	Results were poorer in other categories of patients and poorest in patients with BM involvement .
CONCLUSIONS	Aggressive NHL patients do not benefit from upfront HDS/HDT .

OBJECTIVE	Ischemia-reperfusion injury is an important cause of renal dysfunction after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
OBJECTIVE	Human atrial natriuretic peptide ( hANP ) is a potent endogenous natriuretic , diuretic , and vasorelaxant peptide .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of hANP on renal function in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled study
METHODS	Intensive care unit of a university hospital .
METHODS	Forty patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
METHODS	The patients were randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either hANP ( @-@ @ microg/kg/min ) ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) immediately before aortic cross-clamping .
METHODS	The infusion of hANP or placebo continued for @ hrs .
RESULTS	Blood and urine samples were taken before surgery , at admission to the intensive care unit , and on days @ , @ , and @ postoperatively , for measurement of serum concentrations of sodium , creatinine , and blood urea nitrogen and plasma concentrations of ANP and brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) .
RESULTS	Urine volume and urinary concentrations of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase ( NAG ) , sodium , and creatinine were also measured .
RESULTS	The mean plasma concentration of ANP was significantly higher in the hANP group than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The mean plasma BNP concentration was significantly lower in the hANP group than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The mean serum concentrations of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were significantly ( p < @ ) lower in the hANP group than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The mean urine volume and mean creatinine clearance were significantly ( p < @ ) higher in the hANP group than in the placebo group .
RESULTS	The mean urinary NAG/creatinine ratio was significantly ( p < @ ) lower in the hANP group than in the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	The intraoperative and postoperative infusion of low-dose hANP preserved renal function in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic hANP infusion on perioperative renal outcome .

OBJECTIVE	Theophylline has been shown to delay the onset of myocardial ischemia and to prolong exercise duration .
OBJECTIVE	The present study was done to evaluate the mechanisms and actions of intravenous theophylline on the onset of ischemia and exercise duration .
BACKGROUND	The ischemic threshold may be altered by the differential coronary vasodilation induced by endogenous adenosine .
BACKGROUND	Theophylline is a competitive receptor antagonist of adenosine and may have a potential as an anti-ischemic medication .
METHODS	A double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover trial using an infusion of intravenous theophylline ( @ + / - @ mg/liter ) or placebo before exercise in @ patients was done .
METHODS	Oxygen uptake , heart rate , blood pressure and heart rate-blood pressure product were determined at the onset of > or = @-mV ST segment depression and angina pectoris , as well as at peak exercise .
METHODS	The extent of myocardial ischemia was evaluated by electrocardiographic criteria and quantitation of thallium-@ images at peak exercise .
RESULTS	When compared with placebo , theophylline significantly delayed time to the onset of exercise-induced ischemia .
RESULTS	Ischemia occurred at a higher heart rate-blood pressure product and oxygen uptake .
RESULTS	Exercise duration was prolonged but was not associated with greater ischemia , as determined by oxygen uptake , ST segment depression , angina pectoris and size of thallium-@ defect .
CONCLUSIONS	It is concluded that theophylline favorably alters myocardial ischemia not only by delaying its onset but also by enabling it to occur at a higher threshold without causing deleterious effects during exercise .
CONCLUSIONS	The mechanism for the increased ischemic threshold may be through the inhibition of adenosine and the coronary steal phenomenon .

BACKGROUND	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are used in patients who have myocardial infarction with left ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction .
BACKGROUND	Few data are available in patients whose LV function is within the normal range .
RESULTS	The Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study was a @-year , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study of @ patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction and was designed to investigate the effects of the early ( < @ hours ) administration of fosinopril and thrombolysis on ( @ ) changes in echocardiographically evaluated LV volumes at @ months and ( @ ) long-term occurrence of death and congestive heart failure .
RESULTS	LV volumes were normal at baseline in more than @ % of patients and were comparable between groups both at baseline and after @ months of treatment .
RESULTS	Fosinopril-treated patients showed a @ % reduction in the @-year combined prevalence of death or moderate-to-severe congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association class III-IV ) despite having a worse clinical profile at baseline .
RESULTS	The benefit of fosinopril was confirmed both in patients without congestive heart failure at admission and in those with ejection fraction > @ % at baseline .
RESULTS	Moreover , the incidence of significant ventricular arrhythmias was lower in the fosinopril group ( @ % vs @ % , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of the Fosinopril in Acute Myocardial Infarction Study suggest that early treatment with fosinopril can benefit patients with acute myocardial infarction in addition to a prevention of LV remodeling .

BACKGROUND	Atrial fibrillation is a relatively frequent atrial arrhythmias activated with increased morbidity and mortality .
METHODS	To assess the propafenone and sotalol efficacy in the prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( FA ) we enrolled , in a double blind placebo controlled study over @ year , @ patients ( @ males ) ; mean age @ + / - @ years , randomized to receive orally , three times daily , either propafenone ( mean daily dose of @ + / - @ mg/Kg ; Group A : @ patients ) or sotalol ( mean daily dose of @ + / - @ mg/Kg ; Group B : @ patients ) or placebo ( Group C : @ patients ) .
METHODS	All subjects experienced in previous @ months at least @ FA episodes .
METHODS	During follow-up we considered atrial tachyarrhythmia ( TAA ) onset : FA recurrences and/or the onset of atrial flutter ( FIA ) .
METHODS	Three patients ( @ % ) of Group A and @ ( @ % ) of Group B interrupted therapy for side effects ; @ patients ( @ % ) of Group C with supraventricular tachycardia interrupted the double blind therapy ; @ were lost to follow-up .
RESULTS	Of the remaining @ patients , TAA were observed in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in Group A , @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in Group B and @ ( @ % ) of @ patients in Group C. TAA were significantly less in A and B groups than in Group C ( p < @ ) ; a significant TAA reduction was also observed in patients treated with sotalol compared with those treated with propafenone ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	TAA were : FA-@ ( @ % ) and FIA-@ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The arrhythmia free time was significantly shorter in Group C.
CONCLUSIONS	Sotalol seems to be more effective than propafenone and therefore represents a valid alternative for FA prevention .

OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of remifentanil vs. a lidocaine-esmolol combination in blunting the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation during rapid sequence induction using thiopental and rocuronium in normotensive patients .
METHODS	Sixty-six patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status class I who required tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of two groups .
METHODS	Group R received @ % saline @ ml and remifentanil @ microg/kg .
METHODS	Group LE received lidocaine @ mg/kg and esmolol @ mg/kg .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium @ mg/kg , followed by rocuronium @ mg/kg .
METHODS	Mean arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded at baseline , after induction , immediately after intubation and every minute for five minutes after intubation .
RESULTS	Changes in mean arterial pressure over time between the two groups were significantly different ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The maximum pressor response was observed immediately after intubation , at which time the mean arterial pressure change from baseline in group LE ( @ % ) ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] : @ , @ ) was higher than that in group R ( @ % ) ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Two patients in group R and @ patients in group LE developed hypertension ( odds ratio [ OR ] : @ ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Changes in heart rate over time between the two groups were not significantly different ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study show that remifentanil @ mg/kg is more effective than the combination of lidocaine @ mg/kg and esmolol @ mg/kg for attenuating the hemodynamic responses to rapid sequence intubation .

BACKGROUND	Postpartum weight retention is a risk factor for long-term weight gain .
BACKGROUND	Encouraging new mothers to consume a healthy diet may result in weight loss .
OBJECTIVE	To assess predictors of diet quality during the early postpartum period ; to determine whether diet quality , energy intake , and lactation status predicted weight change from @ to @ months postpartum ; and to determine whether an intervention improved diet quality , reduced energy intake , and achieved greater weight loss compared with usual care .
METHODS	Randomized clinical trial ( KAN-DO : Kids and Adults Now-Defeat Obesity ) , a family - and home-based , @-month , behavioral intervention to prevent childhood obesity , with secondary aims to improve diet and physical activity habits of mothers to promote postpartum weight loss .
METHODS	Overweight/obese , postpartum women ( n = @ ) , recruited from @ counties in the Piedmont region of North Carolina .
METHODS	Eight education kits , each mailed monthly ; motivational counseling ; and one group class .
METHODS	Anthropometric measurements and @-hour dietary recalls collected at baseline ( approximately @ months postpartum ) and follow-up ( approximately @ months later ) .
METHODS	Diet quality was determined using the Healthy Eating Index-@ ( HEI-@ ) .
METHODS	Descriptive statistics , ( @ ) , analysis of variance , bi - and multivariate analyses were used .
RESULTS	At baseline , mothers consumed a low-quality diet ( HEI-@ score = @ @ ) .
RESULTS	Breastfeeding and income were positive , significant predictors of diet quality , whereas body mass index was a negative predictor .
RESULTS	Diet quality did not predict weight change .
RESULTS	However , total energy intake , not working outside of the home , and breastfeeding duration/intensity were negative predictors of weight loss .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in changes in diet quality , decreases in energy intake , or weight loss between the intervention ( @ @ kg ) and control ( @ @ kg ) arms .
CONCLUSIONS	The family-based intervention did not promote postpartum weight loss .
CONCLUSIONS	Reducing energy intake , rather than improving diet quality , should be the focus of weight-loss interventions for overweight/obese postpartum women .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the role of resistance mutations in subjects experiencing virological failure on zidovudine ( ZDV ) and lamivudine ( @TC ) combined with a protease inhibitor ( PI ) to those failing on ZDV/@TC alone .
METHODS	Samples were obtained from previously antiretroviral therapy-naive subjects enrolled into two studies , AVANTI @ and AVANTI @ .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to receive either : ZDV/@TC or ZDV/@TC plus indinavir ( IDV ) for @ weeks ( AVANTI @ ) , and ZDV/@TC or ZDV/@TC and nelfinavir ( NFV ) for @ weeks ( AVANTI @ ) .
METHODS	Emergence of viral resistance mutations was monitored by population sequencing and phenotypic resistance was determined by the recombinant virus assay .
RESULTS	Genotypic data were obtained for subjects with plasma HIV-@ RNA > @ copies/ml .
RESULTS	In AVANTI @ , ZDV mutations were detected in @ % of ZDV/@TC-treated patients at week @ , but were absent in subjects treated with ZDV/@TC/IDV .
RESULTS	No subjects from either arm of AVANTI @ developed ZDV resistance mutations at week @ .
RESULTS	The M@V mutation developed in most ZDV/@TC-treated subjects from both studies .
RESULTS	The presence of M@V was , however , associated with significantly lower plasma viral RNA levels when compared with values obtained before initiation of treatment .
RESULTS	There was a high frequency ( @ of @ ) of the protease L@F substitution in ZDV/@TC/IDV-treated patients that was associated with virological failure but did not result in phenotypic resistance to any of the PIs tested .
CONCLUSIONS	ZDV mutations were not detected in ZDV/@TC/PI-treated patients and they developed slowly in those treated with ZDV/@TC .
CONCLUSIONS	Few protease mutations known to confer phenotypic PI resistance developed in the ZDV/@TC/PI arms of either study .
CONCLUSIONS	The low prevalence of ZDV and PI mutations is encouraging regarding the future treatment options of these patients .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lacosamide ( @ and @ mg/day ) when added to one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures .
METHODS	This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial randomized patients ( age @-@ years ) with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization to placebo , lacosamide @ , or lacosamide @ mg/day .
METHODS	The trial consisted of an @-week baseline , a @-week titration , and a @-week maintenance period .
RESULTS	Four hundred eighty-five patients were randomized and received trial medication .
RESULTS	Among these , @ % were taking two or more concomitant AEDs .
RESULTS	Median percent reduction in seizure frequency per @ days from baseline to maintenance period ( intent-to-treat , ITT ) was @ % for placebo , @ % for lacosamide @ mg/day ( p = @ ) , and @ % for @ mg/day ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the per protocol population , the reductions were @ % for lacosamide @ mg/day ( p = @ ) and @ % for @ mg/day ( p = @ ) compared to placebo ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The @ % responder rate for lacosamide @ mg/day ( @ % ) was significant ( p = @ ) over placebo ( @ % ) , but was not for @ mg/day ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	In the per protocol population , the @ % responder rate for lacosamide @ mg/day ( @ % ) was significant ( p < @ ) compared with the placebo responder rate ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Dose-related adverse events ( AEs ) included dizziness , nausea , and vomiting .
RESULTS	Clinically relevant changes in the mean plasma concentrations of commonly used AEDs were not observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Results of this trial demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of adjunctive lacosamide @ and @ mg/day and support that lacosamide may be an advantageous option for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy .

BACKGROUND	Since the first laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) was reported in @ , it has met with widespread acceptance as a standard procedure using four trocars .
BACKGROUND	The fourth ( lateral ) trocar is used to grasp the fundus of the gallbladder so as to expose Calot 's triangle .
BACKGROUND	It has been argued that the fourth trocar is not necessary in most cases .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , the aim of this study was to compare the three-port vs the four-port technique .
METHODS	Between @ and @ , @ consecutive patients undergoing elective LC for gallstone disease were randomized to be treated via either the three - or four-port technique .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the two groups in age , sex , or weight .
RESULTS	In terms of outcome , there was no difference between the two groups in success rate , operating time , number of oral analgesic tablets ( paracetamol ) , visual analogue score , or postoperative hospital stay ; however , the three-port group required fewer analgesic injections ( nalbuphine ) ( @ vs @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The three-port technique is as safe as the standard four-port one for LC .
CONCLUSIONS	The main advantages of the three-port technique are that it causes less pain , is less expensive , and leaves fewer scars .

BACKGROUND	Angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors differ in their lipophilic/hydrophilic index that determines their tissue bioavailability and affinity to ACE , which may result in major differences in the degree of blockade of cardiac ACE .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the hypothesis that in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) and activated cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) , lipophilic ACE inhibitors with high affinity for ACE ( perindopril and quinapril ) will cause marked blockade of cardiac angiotensin ( Ang ) II and aldosterone generation , but not a hydrophilic ACE inhibitor with low affinity for ACE ( lisinopril ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive perindopril ( @ mg/day ) , quinapril ( @ mg/day ) , or lisinopril ( @ mg/day ) for @-@ weeks before cardiac catheterization .
METHODS	The coronary sinus-aortic root gradients for Ang I and II , and aldosterone were determined .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients completed the study .
RESULTS	Compared to a healthy control group , all three ACE inhibitors decreased circulating Ang II and aldosterone to a similar extent .
RESULTS	There were only minor differences between the three ACE inhibitors for the Ang II gradient between the coronary sinus and aortic root .
RESULTS	The gradient for aldosterone tended to be positive in the quinapril group and absent/negative in the lisinopril and perindopril groups .
RESULTS	Despite the lowest pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) , gradients between the coronary sinus and aortic root for Ang II and aldosterone were actually the highest in the quinapril group .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings do not support the concept that a hydrophilic ACE inhibitor is less effective in blocking the cardiac RAAS as compared to lipophilic ACE inhibitors .

OBJECTIVE	A new , ready-to-use solution for injection of paracetamol ( Perfalgan @ mg/ml ) without previous reconstitution has been developed .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to determine the serum concentration profiles of paracetamol after @ min infusion of Perfalgan @ g and @ g doses and to demonstrate the bioequivalence between Perfalgan @ g dose and a marketed reference formulation for injection , propacetamol @ g ( Pro-Dafalgan @ g ) equivalent to @ g of paracetamol .
OBJECTIVE	The secondary objective was to evaluate local tolerance , and clinical and biological safety .
METHODS	The study was performed in @ healthy , male volunteers , according to an open-label , randomized , single-dose , @-period crossover design , with a @-week washout period between the doses .
METHODS	Blood samples were taken prior to each administration and at @ time points within the @-hour period following the beginning of each infusion .
METHODS	Serum concentrations of paracetamol were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection .
METHODS	From serum concentration-time data , a non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed to calculate Cmax , tmax , AUC ( inf ) , t ( @/@ ) , MRT , Cl ( T ) and Vd .
METHODS	Log-transformed AUC ( inf ) and Cmax were tested for bioequivalence .
METHODS	The local pain intensity at infusion site was assessed using a @-point categorical scale from @ ( none ) to @ ( severe ) .
METHODS	The clinical and biological safety was evaluated by physical examination with measurements of vital signs and ECG and laboratory tests including hematology and biochemistry .
RESULTS	After infusion of @ g and I g of the new paracetamol solution , C ( max ) and AUC ( inf ) increased proportionally with dosage .
RESULTS	After dose correction to @ g of paracetamol , the mean ( + / - SD ) Cmax ratio was @ + / - @ and @ + / - @ for AUC ratio .
RESULTS	Identical t ( max ) was observed for the @ paracetamol dosages and @ % confidence intervals for t ( @/@ ) , MRT , Cl ( T ) and V ( d ) were within the acceptable interval @-@ @ .
RESULTS	The calculated @ % confidence intervals of the new solution ( Perfalgan @ g ) to marketed solution ( propacetamol @ g ) ratios were @-@ @ ( point estimate @ ) for C ( max ) and @-@ @ ( point estimate @ ) for AUC ( inf ) .
RESULTS	These values were within the acceptable bioequivalence intervals of @ to @ for Cmax and @-@ @ for AUC ( inf ) .
RESULTS	Application site disorders were the most frequently observed adverse events but local pain at infusion site was less reported by subjects after Perfalgan ( @ % ) compared to propacetamol ( @ % ) .

BACKGROUND	Many low-risk patients with pneumonia are hospitalized despite recommendations to treat such patients in the outpatient setting .
OBJECTIVE	To identify the factors associated with the hospitalization of low-risk patients with pneumonia .
METHODS	We analyzed data collected by retrospective chart review for @,@ low-risk patients ( Pneumonia Severity Index [ PSI ] risk classes I to III without evidence of arterial oxygen desaturation ) enrolled in a cluster-randomized trial conducted in @ emergency departments .
RESULTS	Overall , @ ( @ % ) of all low-risk patients were treated as inpatients .
RESULTS	Factors independently associated with an increased odds of hospitalization included PSI risk classes II and III , the presence of medical or psychosocial contraindications to outpatient treatment , comorbid conditions that were not contained in the PSI ( cognitive impairment , history of coronary artery disease , diabetes mellitus , or pulmonary disease ) , multilobar radiographic infiltrates , and home therapy with oxygen , corticosteroids , or antibiotics before presentation .
RESULTS	While @ % of low-risk inpatients had a contraindication to outpatient treatment and @ % had one or more preexisting treatments , comorbid conditions , or radiographic abnormalities not contained in the PSI , @ % had no identifiable risk factors for hospitalization other than PSI risk class II or III .
CONCLUSIONS	Hospital admission appears justified for one-third of low-risk inpatients based upon the presence of one or more contraindications to outpatient treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	At least one-fifth of low-risk inpatients did not have a contraindication to outpatient treatment or an identifiable risk factor for hospitalization , suggesting that treatment of a larger proportion of such low-risk patients in the outpatient setting could be achieved without adversely affecting patient outcomes .

BACKGROUND	VTE is the proximate cause of @,@ deaths in the United States each year .
BACKGROUND	Perioperative VTE risk among surgical patients varies by @-fold , which highlights the importance of risk stratification to identify high-risk patients , in whom chemoprophylaxis can decrease VTE risk , and low-risk patients , for whom the risk-benefit relationship of prophylaxis may be unfavorable .
METHODS	We used data from a statewide surgical quality collaborative for surgical procedures performed between @ and @ .
METHODS	Regression-based techniques identified predictors of @-day VTE while adjusting for procedural complexity and comorbid conditions .
METHODS	A weighted risk index was created and was validated subsequently in a separate , independent dataset .
RESULTS	Data were available for @,@ patients , who were allocated randomly to a derivation or validation cohort .
RESULTS	The @-day VTE rate was @ % ; @ % of the derivation cohort and @ % of the validation cohort received chemoprophylaxis .
RESULTS	Seven risk factors were incorporated into a weighted risk index : personal history of VTE , current cancer , sepsis/septic shock/systemic inflammatory response syndrome , age@ years , BMI@ kg/m@ , male sex , and family history of VTE .
RESULTS	Prediction for @-day VTE was similar in the derivation and validation cohorts ( areas under the receiver operator curve , @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	An @-fold variation in @-day VTE rate was identified .
CONCLUSIONS	A weighted risk index quantifies @-day VTE risk among surgical patients and identifies an @-fold variation in VTE risk among the overall surgical population .

###16634952
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to assess whether identification of subjects with different susceptibility to plaque-induced gingival inflammation is dependent on the length of time of de novo plaque accumulation .
METHODS	Retrospective analysis of data obtained from a recently reported randomized split-mouth localized experimental gingivitis trial involving @ healthy non-smokers .
METHODS	Gingival and plaque index , gingival crevicular fluid volume ( GCF ) , angulated bleeding score , and the derived parameter cumulative plaque exposure ( CPE ) were recorded at days @ , @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	The primary outcome variable to express severity of inflammation was GCF and each subject was a statistical unit .
METHODS	Based on subject distribution of GCF-day @ residuals after standardization for CPE-day @ , two sub-populations ( upper and lower distribution quartiles ) were selected .
METHODS	They were , respectively , defined as `` high responders '' ( HR ) ( n = @ ) and `` low responders '' ( LR ) ( n = @ ) and characterized by significantly different severity of gingivitis to similar amounts of plaque deposits .
METHODS	The same analysis was repeated at days @ and @ .
METHODS	Prevalence of HR and LR was compared between days using the chi ( @ ) [ ML ] test .
RESULTS	For both day @ and day @ , the quartile distribution of LR and HR was statistically significant ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fifty percent of LR and @ % of HR presented a consistent level of susceptibility to plaque-induced gingival inflammation even after only @ and/or @ days of plaque accumulation .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support the concept that the subject-based susceptibility to plaque-induced gingival inflammation is an individual trait , only partly related to the length of time of exposure to plaque .

BACKGROUND	Endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) is simple and quick and has low complication rates .
BACKGROUND	However , the disadvantage of local recurrence or remnant rate limits the use of this technique .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to analyse the outcomes of conventional EMR and EMR with circumferential incision ( CIEMR ) , a simplified modification of EMR , in the endoscopic treatment of rectal carcinoid tumours .
METHODS	A total of @ consecutive patients with rectal carcinoid tumours without regional lymph node enlargement confirmed by endoscopic ultrasonography were included in the study .
METHODS	These patients underwent endoscopic treatment from January @ to September @ and were randomly designated into CIEMR ( n = @ ) or EMR group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	En bloc resection rate , pathological complete resection rate , procedure time , complications and follow-up outcomes were analysed .
RESULTS	The en bloc resection rate was not significantly different between the CIEMR and EMR groups ( @ % versus @ % , P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The pathological complete resection rate was higher in the CIEMR group than in the EMR group ( @ % versus @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The overall complication rate , delayed bleeding and procedure time were not significantly different between the two groups .
RESULTS	No recurrence was observed in either the EMR or CIEMR group .
CONCLUSIONS	CIEMR optimises the procedure of EMR and simplifies the technique of endoscopic submucosal dissection ; thus , it has a better histologically complete resection rate and more acceptable complication rate than EMR .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , CIEMR may be preferable to conventional EMR for resection of rectal carcinoid tumours less than @ mm .

OBJECTIVE	Contingency management ( CM ) interventions are efficacious in treating cocaine abusing methadone patients , but few studies have examined the effect of age on treatment outcomes in this population .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the impact of age on treatment outcomes in cocaine abusing methadone patients .
METHODS	Data were analyzed from @ patients enrolled in one of three randomized studies that evaluated the efficacy of CM versus standard care ( SC ) treatment .
RESULTS	Age was associated with some demographics and drug use characteristics including racial composition , education , and methadone dose .
RESULTS	Primary drug abuse treatment outcomes did not vary across age groups , but CM had a greater benefit for engendering longer durations of abstinence in the middle/older and older age groups compared to the younger age groups .
RESULTS	At the @-month follow-up , submission of a cocaine positive urine sample was predicted by submission of a cocaine positive sample at intake , higher methadone doses , and assignment to SC rather than CM treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	As substance abusers are living longer , examination of the efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments specifically within older age groups may lead to a better understanding of subpopulations for whom enhanced treatments such as CM are warranted .

BACKGROUND	Palliative care is expected to incorporate comprehensive support for family caregivers given that many caregivers suffer psychological morbidity .
BACKGROUND	However , systematically implemented evidence-based psychological support initiatives are lacking .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to prepare caregivers for the role of supporting a patient with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care by offering a one-to-one psycho-educational intervention .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that primary family caregivers who participated in the intervention would report decreased psychological distress ( primary outcome ) , fewer unmet needs and increased levels of perceived preparedness , competence and positive emotions .
METHODS	A three-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted comparing two versions of the intervention ( one face-to-face visit versus two visits ) plus standard care to a control group ( standard care ) across four sites in Australia .
RESULTS	A total of @ participants were recruited ; @ were in the Control condition , @ in Intervention @ ( one visit ) and @ in Intervention @ ( two visits ) .
RESULTS	Relative to participants in the control group ; the psychological well-being of participants in the intervention condition was improved by a small amount but non-significantly .
RESULTS	No significant reduction in unmet needs or improvements in positive aspects of caregiving amongst the intervention group were identified .
RESULTS	However , the intervention demonstrated significant improvements in participants ' levels of preparedness and competence for Intervention @ .
CONCLUSIONS	This research adds to accumulating body of evidence demonstrating that relatively short psycho-educational interventions can enable family caregivers to feel more prepared and competent in the role of supporting a dying relative .
CONCLUSIONS	Further investigation is required to determine the longer term outcomes of such interventions .

METHODS	Ninety-six transplant recipients were randomly assigned to @ groups at @ month posttransplantation : the exercise training ( EX group ; n = @ ) and usual care groups ( UC group ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Testing was performed at baseline and @ months posttransplantation and included maximal exercise testing and evaluation of CHD risk factors and risk-factor categories , determined by means of the Framingham equations .
RESULTS	Overall @-year CHD risk score did not change in either group .
RESULTS	All patients showed increases in total cholesterol ( TC ) level , high-density lipoprotein fraction of cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , and body mass index over time .
RESULTS	No differences were observed between groups , except for a trend toward greater improvement in HDL cholesterol levels in the EX group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients in the EX group moved out of the high-risk category in TC-HDL ratio .
RESULTS	All patients remained in the high-risk category for physical fitness .
RESULTS	There was a significant negative correlation of CHD risk and maximal exercise capacity ( r = -@ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Exercise training alone does not reduce CHD risk during the first year after transplantation .
CONCLUSIONS	Research to determine the effects of multiple risk interventions during a longer period in transplant recipients is warranted .

OBJECTIVE	Haemodilution resulting from crystalloid priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit represents a major risk factor for blood transfusions in high-risk cardiac surgery patients .
OBJECTIVE	We designed this study to evaluate the effects of antegrade autologous priming ( AAP ) on reducing perioperative blood transfusion and markers of the inflammatory response in older patients ( > @ years ) .
METHODS	Seventy-two patients undergoing first-time coronary bypass and/or aortic valve replacement were prospectively randomised to a cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) with or without AAP .
METHODS	AAP was performed by adding the patient 's own blood to the prime solution ( mean @ ml ) .
METHODS	Perfusion and anaesthetic techniques were as usual .
METHODS	The haematocrit was maintained at a minimum of @ % during CPB .
METHODS	Patients were well matched for all preoperative variables , including established transfusion risk factors .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the requirement of red cell transfusion .
METHODS	The surrogate endpoints were renal function , inflammatory response and ischaemic parameters .
METHODS	Blood samples were drawn pre - and intraoperatively and at intervals of @ hours till POD @ .
RESULTS	Current analysis shows no differences in patients receiving homologous packed red cell transfusions .
RESULTS	Also , markers of the inflammatory response ( IL@ , IL@ ) , renal function ( cystatin C , creatinine ) and myocardial ischaemia ( troponin T , CK-MB ) were comparable in both groups ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Clinical outcomes were similar with respect to pulmonary , renal and hepatic function , length of ICU stay and hospital stay .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that antegrade autologous priming is a safe procedure , but an ineffective way for improving biocompatibility and reducing the need for blood transfusion in older patients .

BACKGROUND	Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) is a relatively new treatment for hypersplenism .
BACKGROUND	The results of a randomized clinical trial comparing RFA and splenectomy with @ years of follow-up are reported .
METHODS	Fifty-seven patients with hypersplenism due to liver cirrhosis were assigned randomly ( in a @ : @ ratio ) to splenectomy ( @ patients ) or RFA ( @ ) .
METHODS	The RFA group was subdivided according to the percentage of the spleen ablated : less than @ per cent ( @ patients ) , @-@ per cent ( @ ) or over @ per cent ( @ ) .
METHODS	Routine blood tests were performed before and after operation , and total spleen volume and ablated volume were measured by contrast-enhanced computed tomography .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of the trial was recurrence of hypersplenism , assessed as platelet and white cell counts , at @ years after surgery .
RESULTS	White cell and platelet counts increased rapidly after intervention in both groups .
RESULTS	By @ months after operation peripheral platelet and white cell counts had decreased significantly in the RFA group compared with the splenectomy group , and declined to baseline levels by @ months .
RESULTS	Hypersplenism recurred after @ months in patients with less than @ per cent of the spleen ablated .
RESULTS	Blood cell count in the splenectomy group and in patients with more than @ per cent of the spleen ablated decreased with time after operation , but to levels that remained significantly higher than those before operation ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Splenic volume reached its nadir @ months after RFA and then increased with time .
CONCLUSIONS	Splenic RFA represents an attractive alternative treatment for hypersplenism induced by liver cirrhosis , particularly when more than @ per cent of the spleen is ablated .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the effect of multi-glycosides of tripterygii ( MT ) on latent autoimmune diabetes of adults ( LADA ) in early stage .
METHODS	The diabetic patients were divided randomly into the control group treated with insulin alone and the treated group treated with insulin and MT. Levels of insulin , C-peptide , glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody ( GADAb ) and islet cell antibody ( ICA ) were detected and clinical features of the disease were observed .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the control group and the treated group in body mass index ( BMI ) , the occurrence of diabetic keto-acidosis and the function of liver and kidney ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	After @ months ' treatment , the positive rate of GADAb and ICA decreased , plasma levels of fasting and @ hrs post-prandial C-peptide and also @ hrs post-prandial true insulin in the treated group increased ( P < @ ) , while all the above indexes improved more significantly after @ year 's treatment ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared treatment of insulin with multi-glycosides of tripterygii in early stage of LADA has better effects in relieving autoimmune injury and recovering function of pancreatic island than insulin alone .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment outcomes vary according to the design of the mandibular repositioning appliance ( MRA ) .
OBJECTIVE	Two titratable MRA 's were compared .
OBJECTIVE	The designs differ in advancement hardware and configuration of acrylic both in bulk and interocclusal contact .
METHODS	The primary treatment outcome was the Respiratory Disturbance Index ( RDI ) .
METHODS	Other outcomes that were compared included Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index ( SAQLI ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , oxygen saturation , and subjective feedback regarding experiences with the appliances .
METHODS	Twenty-four subjects were recruited from consecutive referrals for MRA therapy following diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) by polysomnography .
METHODS	Subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment arm of the crossover study .
METHODS	Each subject underwent an initial sleep study with a type III home monitor to establish a baseline RDI .
METHODS	Subjects were then treated with one of the two MRAs determined by random assignment .
METHODS	The MRA self-titration phase was monitored until a treatment position was determined , and the home sleep study was repeated .
METHODS	After a @-week period without any OSA treatment , subjects received the second MRA and the self-titration treatment protocol was repeated .
METHODS	At completion of treatment with each appliance , subjects answered questionnaires and underwent a sleep study with the type III monitor .
METHODS	The outcome data for each appliance were compared using analysis of variance .
RESULTS	Eighteen subjects completed the treatment protocol .
RESULTS	There were no significant statistical differences in treatment outcomes between the two appliances .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant ( p @ ) preference for a MRA design with minimal coverage of teeth and palate .
RESULTS	The subjects ' appliance selection was consistent with a corresponding reduction in SAQLI score for the selected appliance .
CONCLUSIONS	Although no statistically significant difference was observed between the two appliances in the outcomes measured , there was a trend toward greater improvement with the appliance with less acrylic resin bulk and less interocclusal contact .
CONCLUSIONS	MRA selection should favor titratable , unobtrusive designs with appropriate construction to promote acceptance and adherence to MRA therapy .

OBJECTIVE	To compare , in a post hoc analysis of a phase III trial , the maximum recommended doses of fesoterodine ( @ mg ) and tolterodine ( @ mg ) for improving overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptoms and health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) , as fesoterodine effectively reduces OAB symptoms vs placebo .
METHODS	Eligible patients with frequency ( > or = eight voids/@ h ) and either urgency ( > or = six episodes over @ days ) or urgency urinary incontinence ( UUI ; > or = three episodes over @ days ) were randomized to placebo , fesoterodine @ or @ mg , or tolterodine extended-release ( ER ) @ mg for @ weeks ; fesoterodine @ mg data were published elsewhere .
METHODS	Patients completed a @-day bladder diary in which they recorded the time of each void , voided volume ( VV ) , and the severity of urgency .
METHODS	A post hoc inferential analysis was conducted on the primary endpoint ( voids/@ h ) , the two co-primary endpoints ( UUI episodes/@ h and treatment response ) , several secondary endpoints ( severe urgency plus UUI per @ h , mean VV ( MVV ) / void , and continent days/week ) , HRQoL , using the King 's Health Questionnaire ( KHQ ) and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form ( ICIQ-SF ) , and self-reported bladder-related problems .
METHODS	A subanalysis also assessed all endpoints for patients who were incontinent at baseline .
METHODS	Tolerability and safety were assessed by evaluating adverse events , residual urine volume , laboratory variables and treatment withdrawals .
RESULTS	By week @ , patients with OAB in both active-treatment groups showed significant improvements in most bladder diary variables and treatment response rates compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Fesoterodine @ mg was statistically significantly better than tolterodine ER @ mg for improving UUI episodes , severe urgency plus UUI , mean VV , and number of continent days/week .
RESULTS	In addition , the fesoterodine and tolterodine ER groups showed significantly greater improvements in HRQoL than the placebo group , with positive changes in most domains of the KHQ and an improvement in ICIQ-SF score .
RESULTS	The fesoterodine @-mg group had statistically significant improvements over placebo in eight of nine KHQ domains .
RESULTS	A major improvement in the severity of bladder-related problems was reported by @ % of the fesoterodine @ mg and @ % of the tolterodine ER groups vs @ % of those on placebo ( P < or = @ ) .
RESULTS	Results for the subgroup of incontinent patients at baseline were similar to the overall results .
RESULTS	Adverse events reported most commonly with active treatment included dry mouth , constipation , dry eye , dry throat , and nausea .
CONCLUSIONS	Both fesoterodine and tolterodine ER significantly improved OAB symptoms and HRQoL , with statistically significant advantages for fesoterodine @ mg compared with tolterodine ER on several important endpoints .

###11535769
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness of intraarterial lidocaine in controlling pain after uterine artery embolization ( UAE ) .
METHODS	In this double-blind prospective study , patients undergoing UAE received preservative-free @ % lidocaine or saline solution ( control ) in the uterine arteries before embolization .
METHODS	Postprocedural pain was managed with patient-controlled intravenous morphine .
METHODS	Attempted doses , number of doses received , total morphine dose , and maximum pain numeric rating scale ( NRS ) score during the postprocedural hospitalization were recorded and compared .
METHODS	Three-month follow-up magnetic resonance ( MR ) imaging and symptomatic questionnaires were collected and compared .
RESULTS	Ten patients received lidocaine and eight patients received placebo .
RESULTS	Moderate to severe vasospasm was noted in seven patients after lidocaine injection , whereas no vasospasm was noted in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients in the lidocaine group had lower NRS pain scores than those in the placebo group ( P = @ ) , whereas there was no difference in morphine requirement between treated patients and control subjects .
RESULTS	The study was terminated after @ patients were treated as a result of unexpected vasospasm .
CONCLUSIONS	Intraarterial @ % lidocaine is associated with moderate to severe vasospasm .
CONCLUSIONS	Lidocaine significantly lowers subjective pain , but there is no difference in analgesic requirements .
CONCLUSIONS	The routine use of intraarterial lidocaine is not recommended for pain control until the long-term effects of vasospasm on outcome is known .

###9563071
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate mechanistically the effect of food on the absorption and gastrointestinal transit of the protease inhibitor saquinavir .
METHODS	Pharmacoscintigraphic investigation in eight healthy volunteers .
RESULTS	Gastric emptying occurred rapidly in the fasted state with some capsules leaving the stomach prior to disintegration .
RESULTS	Unmeasurable plasma concentrations were observed in several subjects when dosed under fasted conditions .
RESULTS	Following post-prandial administration the radioactive marker became re-distributed within the stomach contents and consequently slower gastric emptying resulted .
RESULTS	Plasma concentrations under fed conditions were measurable up to @ hrs after administration in seven of the eight subjects .
RESULTS	Six of the eight plasma profiles showed secondary peaks at c. @ hours post-dose ; two of which coincided with the gastrocolonic response following ingestion of lunch .
CONCLUSIONS	Bioavailability of saquinavir is significantly improved in the presence of food .
CONCLUSIONS	Emptying of intact capsules in the fasted state may further reduce bioavailability .
CONCLUSIONS	In the fed state , capsules disintegrate rapidly and gastric emptying is prolonged which may improve exposure of the drug to target absorption sites .
CONCLUSIONS	Saquinavir may be absorbed from the colon .
CONCLUSIONS	Second peaks in the absorption profile can only be attributed to gastrocolonic response following ingestion of a meal in some cases .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased absorption is more likely to be due to an increase in dissolved drug being available for absorption due to general increased motility and secretion stimulated by ingestion of a meal .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the quality of pain control achieved with continuous local anesthetic infusion via a femoral nerve catheter , and to determine the optimum concentration of bupivacaine necessary to maintain pain control after full surgical anesthesia is established with @ % bupivacaine .
METHODS	Randomized , prospective study .
METHODS	Tertiary care teaching center .
METHODS	@ ASA physical status I and II patients scheduled to undergo arthroscopically-aided anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction by one surgeon , and who were willing to accept a femoral nerve catheter for postoperative pain control .
METHODS	All patients received general anesthesia with propofol/alfentanil ( @ ml/@ ml ) mixture and nitrous oxide/oxygen ( @ % / @ % ) mixture via endotracheal tube .
METHODS	After induction of general anesthesia , a femoral nerve catheter was inserted with the aid of a nerve stimulator , and @ ml of @ % bupivacaine was administered .
METHODS	The surgery was completed in a standard manner and the patients were randomized into three groups for the concentration of local anesthetic to continue the pain relief into the recovery phase .
METHODS	On awakening , all patients were determined to have a functioning femoral nerve catheter .
METHODS	Group @ received @ % ( n = @ ) bupivacaine , Group @ @ % ( n = @ ) bupivacaine , and Group @ @ % ( n = @ ) bupivacaine ; all doses were initiated in a blinded manner at @ ml/kg/hr .
METHODS	Patients also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with morphine via demand mode only , with a @ mg dose and a @ minute lock-out interval .
RESULTS	Pain was determined at defined intervals by visual analog scale ( VAS ) .
RESULTS	Data collected included demographics , VAS scores , and total morphine administered .
RESULTS	All patients were pain-free on emergence from general anesthesia .
RESULTS	No patient required parenteral opioid for pain control while in the postanesthesia care unit .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in pain scores among groups , and average pain scores ( @ to @ ) indicate good pain control throughout the entire hospitalization .
RESULTS	There were no complications .
CONCLUSIONS	Low concentrations of bupivacaine delivered via femoral nerve catheter after an established femoral nerve block can provide excellent postoperative pain control after ACL reconstruction .

BACKGROUND	We have previously demonstrated improved medical student performance using standardized live patient models in the Trauma Evaluation and Management ( TEAM ) program .
BACKGROUND	The trauma manikin has also been offered as an option for teaching trauma skills in this program .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we compare performance using both models .
METHODS	Final year medical students were randomly assigned to three groups : group I ( n = @ ) with neither model , group II ( n = @ ) with patient model , and group III ( n = @ ) with mechanical model using the same clinical scenario .
METHODS	All students completed pre-TEAM and post-TEAM multiple choice question ( MCQ ) exams and an evaluation questionnaire scoring five items on a scale of @ to @ with @ being the highest .
METHODS	The items were objectives were met , knowledge improved , skills improved , overall satisfaction , and course should be mandatory .
METHODS	Students ( groups II and III ) then switched models , rating preferences in six categories : more challenging , more interesting , more dynamic , more enjoyable learning , more realistic , and overall better model .
METHODS	Scores were analyzed by ANOVA with p < @ being considered statistically significant .
RESULTS	All groups had similar scores ( means % + / - SD ) in the pretest ( group I - @ + / - @ , group II - @ + / - @ , group III - @ + / - @ ) .
RESULTS	All groups improved their post-test scores but groups II and III scored higher than group I with no difference in scores between groups II and III ( group I - @ + / - @ , group II - @ + / - @ , group III - @ + / - @ ) .
RESULTS	The percent of students scoring @ in the questionnaire are as follows : objectives met - @ % for all groups ; knowledge improved : group I - @ % , group II - @ % , group III - @ % ; skills improved : group I - @ % , group II - @ % , group III - @ % ; overall satisfaction : group I - @ % , group II - @ % , group III - @ % ; should be mandatory : group I - @ % , group II - @ % , group III - @ % .
RESULTS	Student preferences ( @ students ) are as follows : the mechanical model was more challenging ( @ of @ ) ; more interesting ( @ of @ ) ; more dynamic ( @ of @ ) ; more enjoyable ( @ of @ ) ; more realistic ( @/@ ) , and better overall model ( @ of @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Using the TEAM program , we have demonstrated that improvement in knowledge and skills are equally enhanced by using mechanical or patient models in trauma teaching .
CONCLUSIONS	However , students overwhelmingly preferred the mechanical model .

BACKGROUND	Acute alcohol intoxication selectively impairs executive functioning and prospective memory ( PM ) .
BACKGROUND	Much previous researches in this area have used laboratorybased tasks that may not mimic functions that individuals with dysexecutive syndrome have problems with in their everyday life .
BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to assess the effects of a modest dose of alcohol on executive functioning and PM using a virtual reality task and investigate the role of executive planning in PM performance .
METHODS	Forty healthy participants were administered @ g/kg alcohol or matched placebo in a doubleblind design .
METHODS	Executive function and PM were assessed using the Jansari-Agnew-Akesson-Murphy ( JAAM ) task , requiring participants to play the role of an office worker .
RESULTS	Alcohol intoxication selectively impaired executive function and PM .
RESULTS	The participants in the alcohol condition performed worse on the planning , prioritisation , creativity and adaptability executive subscales and also on the timebased and eventbased PM tasks .
RESULTS	However , alcohol did not impair the selection executive function task or the actionbased PM task .
CONCLUSIONS	The results provide further support for the effects of alcohol on executive functioning and PM .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the results suggest that such deficits may be present at relatively modest doses of alcohol and in the absence of a subjective feeling of intoxication .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the relationship between the severity of cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) ( American Spinal Injury Association [ ASIA ] grade ) , presence of neurogenic shock , and timing of surgical intervention .
OBJECTIVE	This is a post-hoc analysis from the Sygen multicenter randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Blood pressure ( BP ) and heart rate ( HR ) data were collected when patients were first assessed in the emergency room ( Time A ) and at the time of randomization ( Time B ) .
METHODS	Individuals were subdivided by ASIA grade and by the level of the systolic BP ( SBP ) .
RESULTS	Only individuals with cervical SCI from the Sygen trial ( n = @ ) were evaluated .
RESULTS	Severe complete SCI ( ASIA grade = A ) was established in @ % of these patients .
RESULTS	A total of @ ( @ % ) patients with neurogenic shock ( SBP < @ mmHg ) at Time A were identified .
RESULTS	The SBP increased significantly from Time A to Time B ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The median time from SCI to surgical intervention , for ASIA A , was @ hours for patients with initial SBP < @ mmHg and @ hours for patients with initial SBP > or = @ mmHg ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders revealed a statistically significant difference in the time to surgical intervention based on SBP for ASIA A ( P = @ ) , yet not for ASIA B or C/D .
CONCLUSIONS	The presence of neurogenic shock was associated with a delay in the timing of surgical intervention in patients with cervical SCI .
CONCLUSIONS	Detailed evaluation of autonomic dysfunctions following SCI including cardiovascular instability could improve our understanding of the complexities of clinical presentations and possible neurological outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Referral of patients to smoking cessation telephone counseling ( i.e. , quitline ) is an underutilized resource by primary care physicians .
BACKGROUND	Previously , we conducted a randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of benchmarked feedback on clinician referrals to a quitline .
BACKGROUND	Subsequently , we sought to understand the successful practices used by the high-referring clinicians , and the perceptions of the barriers of referring patients to a quitline among both high and non-referring clinicians in the trial .
METHODS	We conducted a qualitative sub-study with subjects from the randomized trial , comparing high - and non-referring clinicians .
METHODS	Structured interviews were conducted and two investigators employed a thematic analysis of the transcribed data .
METHODS	Themes and included categories were organized into a thematic framework to represent the main response sets .
RESULTS	As compared to non-referring clinicians , high-referring clinicians more often reported use of the quitline as a primary source of referral , an appreciation of the quitline as an additional resource , reduced barriers to use of the quitline referral process , and a greater personal motivation related to tobacco cessation .
RESULTS	Time and competing demands were critical barriers to initiating smoking cessation treatment with patients for all clinicians .
RESULTS	Clinicians reported that having one referral source , a referral coordinator , and reimbursement for tobacco counseling ( as a billable code ) would aid referral .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to test the effectiveness of new approaches in improving the connection of patients with smoking cessation resources .

BACKGROUND	Loss aversion in decision-making refers to a higher sensitivity to losses than to gains .
BACKGROUND	Loss aversion is conceived as an affective interference in cognitive processes such as judgment and decision-making .
BACKGROUND	Loss aversion in non-risky choices has not been studied in schizophrenia .
METHODS	Forty-two individuals with schizophrenia and @ non-patient control subjects , matched by gender and age , were randomized to two different scenarios ( a buying scenario and a selling scenario ) .
METHODS	Subjects were asked to evaluate the price of a decorated mug .
METHODS	Schizophrenia subjects were re-tested four weeks later with the other scenario .
RESULTS	Contrary to non-patient controls , schizophrenia subjects did not show loss aversion .
RESULTS	In the schizophrenia group , absence of loss aversion was correlated with age , duration of illness , number of months in State hospitals , and poorer performance in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , but not with current psychopathology and two domains of emotional experience .
CONCLUSIONS	Absence of loss aversion in schizophrenia represents a deficit in the processing of emotional information during decision-making .
CONCLUSIONS	It can be interpreted as a lack of integration between the emotional and the cognitive systems , or to a more diffuse and de-differentiated impact of emotional information on decision-making .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should bring more clarity to this question .

BACKGROUND	/ st > Airway Scope is a new videolaryngoscope which requires less cervical movement during intubation than direct laryngoscopy .
BACKGROUND	Thus , in patients wearing a rigid cervical collar , we compared the efficacy of the Airway Scope and the gum elastic bougie with Macintosh laryngoscope during tracheal intubation .
METHODS	/ st > Anaesthesia was induced with propofol , fentanyl , and rocuronium .
METHODS	A rigid cervical collar was applied , and patients were randomly assigned to tracheal intubation with an Airway Scope ( n = @ ) or multiple-use gum elastic bougie with Macintosh laryngoscope ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Measurements included intubation time , gum elastic bougie insertion time , intubation success rate , and insertion and intubation attempts .
METHODS	Airway complications were also recorded .
RESULTS	/ st > The time required for successful intubation was significantly shorter with the Airway Scope compared with the gum elastic bougie with Macintosh laryngoscope [ mean ( sd ) @ ( @ ) vs @ ( @ ) s , P = @ ] , although the overall success rate of the Airway Scope ( @ % ) compared with the gum elastic bougie with Macintosh laryngoscope ( @ % ) did not reach the statistical significance ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Oesophageal intubation ( n = @ ) occurred only with the gum elastic bougie with Macintosh laryngoscope .
RESULTS	Incidence of mucosal trauma and lip injury was similar with each device .
RESULTS	No dental injury or hypoxia occurred with either device .
CONCLUSIONS	/ st > The Airway Scope shortens intubation time , is less likely to result in oesophageal intubation , and may offer a marginally higher intubation success rate in patients with simulated restricted neck mobility .

OBJECTIVE	To describe the differences in treatment costs for infants randomized to contact lens correction versus primary intraocular lens ( IOL ) implantation after unilateral cataract surgery in the Infant Aphakia Treatment Study ( IATS ) .
METHODS	Retrospective cost analysis of a prospective , randomized clinical trial based on Georgia Medicaid data and the actual costs of supplies used .
METHODS	The IATS is a randomized , multicenter ( n = @ ) clinical trial comparing treatment of aphakia with a primary IOL or contact lens in @ infants with unilateral congenital cataract .
METHODS	Infants underwent cataract surgery with or without placement of an IOL .
METHODS	The mean cost of cataract surgery and all additional surgeries , examinations , and supplies used up to @ months of age .
RESULTS	The mean cost of treatment for a unilateral congenital cataract with primary IOL implantation was $ @ @ versus $ @ @ with contact lens correction .
RESULTS	The initial cataract surgery accounted for approximately @ % of the treatment costs for both groups .
RESULTS	Contact lens costs accounted for @ % ( $ @/patient ) in the aphakic group , whereas glasses costs represented only @ % ( $ @/patient ) in the IOL group .
RESULTS	The increased costs in the IOL group were primarily due to the higher cost of cataract surgery in this group ( $ @ vs. $ @ ) and the cost of additional operations .
CONCLUSIONS	For IATS patients up to @ months of age , cataract surgery coupled with IOL implantation and spectacle correction was @ % ( $ @ ) more expensive than cataract surgery coupled with contact lens correction .

OBJECTIVE	Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) not only enhance cellular glucose transport but are reported to have potent anti-inflammatory effects .
OBJECTIVE	These effects may play an important role in the insulin sensitizing mechanism , and possibly precede the effects on parameters of glucoregulation .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to investigate whether these anti-inflammatory effects could yield early responding biomarkers for TZD action in Type @ diabetes mellitus ( T@DM ) patients and healthy volunteers ( HV ) to expedite early clinical development of novel compounds .
METHODS	We investigated the timing of treatment effects on several proinflammatory cytokines and markers of inflammation in comparison with effects on typical measures of glucoregulation in T@DM patients and HV receiving rosiglitazone @ mg or placebo twice daily for @ weeks .
RESULTS	We found a significant reduction in interleukin ( IL ) -@ [ -@ % , confidence interval ( CI ) - @ , - @ ] and white blood cell count ( -@ % , CI - @ , - @ ) after @ weeks of treatment in the T@DM group .
RESULTS	These anti-inflammatory effects did not precede the effects on typical parameters of glucoregulation in the T@DM group and there was no significant anti-inflammatory response in the HV group .
CONCLUSIONS	We could not identify biomarkers that precede the effects of rosiglitazone on parameters of glucoregulation in T@DM or that have a significant response in HV .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the IL-@ response observed in this study indicates a potential role for this cytokine as complementary biomarker in clinical ` proof of concept ' studies with novel TZDs .

BACKGROUND	Some researchers have suggested that the serum vitamin D ( VitD ) level may relate to disease activity .
BACKGROUND	The current study was designed to identify the correlation between vitaminD prescription and prevention of relapses in rheumatoid arthritis .
METHODS	A double blinded , randomized controlled trial study was performed using @RA patients .
METHODS	RA was controlled and patients were in remission during the past @months .
METHODS	Serum level of VitD in the studied patients was below @ng/dl .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated to receive VitD or placebo .
METHODS	In the @-month follow-up period , the Disease Activity Score @ ( DAS@ ) was used in case of relapses as an index of RA activity to compare the two groups .
RESULTS	The flare rate was not different between two groups ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	The odds ratio of the rate of decline in patients of the trial group compared with the control group was @ ( not significant ; p > @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean DAS@ between the two patient groups was not significant ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A low VitD level was not identified to be a risk factor for RA severity or flare ups ; however , although not statistically significant , VitD treatment might be clinically effective .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed with more emphasis on the issue of cost effectiveness and clinical importance to provide more information .

BACKGROUND	Corticosteroids are widely used in pediatric open-heart surgery to reduce systemic inflammatory response and to mediate possible cardioprotective effects .
BACKGROUND	However , the optimal dosing of corticosteroids is unknown and their administration varies considerably between different institutions .
METHODS	Forty neonates undergoing open-heart surgery were randomized in a double-blind fashion equally into @ groups .
METHODS	After the induction of anesthesia , @ group received @ mg/kg intravenous methylprednisolone and the other a placebo .
METHODS	Concentrations in plasma of interleukin @ ( IL-@ ) , IL-@ , IL-@ , free methylprednisolone and total methylprednisolone were obtained for the following : ( @ ) at anesthesia induction before the study drug was administered ; ( @ ) @ minutes on cardiopulmonary bypass ; ( @ ) @ minutes after protamine administration ; and ( @ ) @ hours after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass .
METHODS	Troponin T was measured at time points T@ , T@ , T@ , and also at @:@ on the first postoperative morning .
METHODS	Physiological and clinical outcome parameters were also recorded .
RESULTS	Intravenous methylprednisolone resulted in high plasma drug concentrations that peaked at T@ .
RESULTS	Methylprednisolone significantly lowered concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines IL-@ and IL-@ and raised levels of anti-inflammatory IL-@ .
RESULTS	No significant differences in troponin T levels were detected .
RESULTS	Blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the methylprednisolone group , and patients in this group received more often insulin therapy than controls .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in other clinical or physiological outcome measurements .
CONCLUSIONS	Intravenous @ mg/kg methylprednisolone administered before cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in high effective plasma drug concentrations and a decreased inflammatory response .
CONCLUSIONS	However , no cardioprotective effect or better clinical outcome was noticed .

BACKGROUND	Febrile neutropenia ( FN ) remains a major dose-limiting complication among patients treated with chemotherapy .
BACKGROUND	Haematopoietic colony stimulating factors ( G-CSF and GM-CSF ) made possible a significant improvement in the management of FN , both in the therapeutic and in the prophylactic approach .
BACKGROUND	The use of antibiotic prophylaxis also permits a definite reduction of severe infections during neutropenia .
BACKGROUND	Nevertheless , the possible role of these two interventions for secondary prevention of FN is still unclear .
METHODS	We conducted a prospective randomised trial by comparing the efficacy of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) and the association of G-CSF with oral antibiotics in the secondary prevention of FN .
METHODS	We included in our study those patients who , after an episode of FN , continued to be treated with the same chemotherapy without reduction of dose intensity .
METHODS	They were randomised into two groups : the first received G-CSF ( group G ; filgrastim , @ microg/kg day ) , and the second was treated with an association of G-CSF and amoxicillin/clavulanate plus ciprofloxacin ( group G/ACC ) .
RESULTS	Forty-eight patients were randomised ( group G : n = @ and group G/ACC : n = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no recurrence of FN among the patients receiving G-CSF and only one episode in the combined therapy group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	With regard to the side effects , there was no significant difference in the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of G-CSF for the secondary prevention of FN is extremely effective and allows the maintenance of chemotherapy dose intensity .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study showed that the addition of antibiotics does not seem to be required .

BACKGROUND	Endovascular treatment ( angioplasty with or without stenting ) is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy for carotid artery stenosis but there are scarce long-term efficacy data showing that it prevents stroke .
BACKGROUND	We therefore report the long-term results of the Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study ( CAVATAS ) .
METHODS	Between March , @ , and July , @ , patients who presented at a participating centre with a confirmed stenosis of the internal carotid artery that was deemed equally suitable for either carotid endarterectomy or endovascular treatment were randomly assigned to either treatment in equal proportions by telephone or fax from the randomisation service at the Oxford Clinical Trials Unit , UK .
METHODS	Patients were seen by an independent neurologist at @ and @ months after treatment and then every year after randomisation for as long as possible , up to a maximum of @ years .
METHODS	Major outcome events were transient ischaemic attack , non-disabling , disabling , and fatal stroke , myocardial infarction , and death from any other cause .
METHODS	Outcomes were adjudicated on by investigators who were masked to treatment .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This study is registered , number ISRCTN @ .
RESULTS	@ patients with stenosis of the carotid artery ( @ % symptomatic ) were randomly assigned to endovascular treatment ( n = @ ) or surgery ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Within @ days of treatment , there were more minor strokes that lasted less than @ days in the endovascular group ( @ vs @ ) but the number of other strokes in any territory or death was the same ( @ vs @ ) .
RESULTS	There were more cranial nerve palsies ( @ vs @ ) in the endarterectomy group than in the endovascular group .
RESULTS	Median length of follow up in both groups was @ years ( IQR @-@ ) .
RESULTS	By comparing endovascular treatment with endarterectomy after the @-day post-treatment period , the @-year incidence and hazard ratio ( HR ) at the end of follow-up for ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke was @ % versus @ % ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ) ; for ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke or TIA was @ % versus @ % ( @ , @-@ @ ) ; and for any non-perioperative stroke was @ % versus @ % ( @ , @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	More patients had stroke during follow-up in the endovascular group than in the surgical group , but the rate of ipsilateral non-perioperative stroke was low in both groups and none of the differences in the stroke outcome measures was significant .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the study was underpowered and the confidence intervals were wide .
CONCLUSIONS	More long-term data are needed from the on going stenting versus endarterectomy trials .

BACKGROUND	In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial ( ALLHAT ) , a randomized , double-blind , practice-based , active-control , comparative effectiveness trial in high-risk hypertensive participants , risk of new-onset heart failure ( HF ) was higher in the amlodipine ( @-@ mg/d ) and lisinopril ( @-@ mg/d ) arms compared with the chlorthalidone ( @-@ mg/d ) arm .
BACKGROUND	Similar to other studies , mortality rates following new-onset HF were very high ( @ % at @ years ) , and were similar across randomized treatment arms .
BACKGROUND	After the randomized phase of the trial ended in @ , outcomes were determined from administrative databases .
RESULTS	With the use of national databases , posttrial follow-up mortality through @ was obtained on participants who developed new-onset HF during the randomized ( in-trial ) phase of ALLHAT .
RESULTS	Mean follow-up for the entire period was @ years .
RESULTS	Of @ participants with incident HF in-trial , @ died .
RESULTS	Post-HF all-cause mortality was similar across treatment groups , with adjusted hazard ratios ( @ % confidence intervals ) of @ ( @-@ @ ) and @ ( @-@ @ ) , respectively , for amlodipine and lisinopril compared with chlorthalidone , and @-year adjusted rates of @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	All-cause mortality rates were also similar among those with reduced ejection fractions ( @ % ) and preserved ejection fractions ( @ % ) , with no significant differences by randomized treatment arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Once HF develops , risk of death is high and consistent across randomized treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Measures to prevent the development of HF , especially blood pressure control , must be a priority if mortality associated with the development of HF is to be addressed .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Trial Registration - http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .
CONCLUSIONS	Unique identifier : NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Available data concerning effects of testosterone on endometrium of postmenopausal women are seriously limited .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to compare the influence of treatment with testosterone and/or estrogen on endometrial proliferation in healthy postmenopausal women .
METHODS	This was an open , randomized clinical study with parallel comparison of the groups .
METHODS	The study was conducted at a women 's health clinical research unit and a research laboratory at a university hospital .
METHODS	Sixty-three women who had experienced natural menopause participated in this study .
METHODS	After random assignment , the participants were administered orally testosterone undecanoate ( @ mg every second day ) , estradiol valerate ( @ mg daily ) , or both for @ months .
METHODS	Endometrial thickness was measured , and endometrial proliferation evaluated on the basis of histopathology and expression of Ki-@ , a proliferation marker .
RESULTS	Endometrial thickness was significantly increased by treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with testosterone but was unaltered by testosterone alone .
RESULTS	Among the women receiving estrogen alone , the proportion exhibiting histopathology indicative of proliferation increased significantly to @ % ( P < @ ) , there was a nonsignificant increase to @ % with the combined treatment , whereas testosterone alone had no effect at all .
RESULTS	Expression of Ki-@ was up-regulated significantly in both glands and stroma ( P < @ , respectively ) in both estrogen treatment groups .
RESULTS	However , the expression was significantly higher in stroma by estrogen treatment alone than after combined treatment ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The short-term treatment with testosterone of postmenopausal women does not stimulate endometrial proliferation .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , testosterone appears to counteract endometrial proliferation induced by estrogen to a certain extent .

BACKGROUND	Remifentanil is often combined with propofol for induction and maintenance of total intravenous anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	The authors studied the effect of propofol on remifentanil requirements for suppression of responses to clinically relevant stimuli and evaluated this in relation to previously published data on propofol and alfentanil .
METHODS	With ethics committee approval and informed consent , @ unpremedicated female patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status class I or II , aged @-@ yr , scheduled to undergo lower abdominal surgery , were randomly assigned to receive a target-controlled infusion of propofol with constant target concentrations of @ , @ , or @ microg/ml .
METHODS	The target concentration of remifentanil was changed in response to signs of inadequate anesthesia .
METHODS	Arterial blood samples for the determination of remifentanil and propofol concentrations were collected after blood-effect site equilibration .
METHODS	The presence or absence of responses to various perioperative stimuli were related to the propofol and remifentanil concentrations by response surface modeling or logistic regression , followed by regression analysis .
METHODS	Both additive and nonadditive interaction models were explored .
RESULTS	With blood propofol concentrations increasing from @ to @ microg/ml , the C ( @ ) of remifentanil decreased from @ ng/ml to @ ng/ml for laryngoscopy , from @ ng/ml to @ ng/ml for intubation , and from @ ng/ml to @ ng/ml for intraabdominal surgery .
RESULTS	With blood remifentanil concentrations increasing from @ to @ ng/ml , the C ( @ ) of propofol for the return to consciousness decreased from @ microg/ml to @ microg/ml .
CONCLUSIONS	Propofol reduces remifentanil requirements for suppression of responses to laryngoscopy , intubation , and intraabdominal surgical stimulation in a synergistic manner .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , remifentanil decreases propofol concentrations associated with the return of consciousness in a synergistic manner .

BACKGROUND	The potential to improve cognition in older women with estrogen or estrogen/progesterone therapy is currently a matter of intense debate .
BACKGROUND	Only a few studies conducted so far have used electrophysiological indicators of cognitive information processing as outcome measures in randomised placebo controlled studies .
OBJECTIVE	This study was undertaken to measure changes in event-related potentials ( ERPs ) after short ( @ weeks ) or prolonged ( @ weeks ) hormone treatment in older women .
METHODS	A randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study in hysterectomized older women ( aged @-@ years ) was performed ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The participants received orally estradiol ( @ mg estradiol valerate ) , estradiol plus progesterone ( @ mg micronized progesterone ) or placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	Using four different paradigms , early and late ERPs were assessed at baseline and after @ and @ weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	Strong hormone increases were observed in the two active treatment groups .
RESULTS	However , no significant effects on any of the assessed ERPs were observed in either of the two treatment groups .
RESULTS	Similar non-significant findings were obtained for reaction time and error rate .
CONCLUSIONS	Estradiol or estradiol/progesterone treatment appears to have no strong effects on several ERP markers of information processing in older hysterectomized women .
CONCLUSIONS	The current negative findings might suggest a reduced sensitivity of the aged brain to gonadal steroids .

BACKGROUND	Although mindfulness meditation interventions have recently shown benefits for reducing stress in various populations , little is known about their relative efficacy compared with relaxation interventions .
OBJECTIVE	This randomized controlled trial examines the effects of a @-month mindfulness meditation versus somatic relaxation training as compared to a control group in @ students ( M age = @ ; @ men and @ women ) reporting distress .
METHODS	Psychological distress , positive states of mind , distractive and ruminative thoughts and behaviors , and spiritual experience were measured , while controlling for social desirability .
RESULTS	Hierarchical linear modeling reveals that both meditation and relaxation groups experienced significant decreases in distress as well as increases in positive mood states over time , compared with the control group ( p < @ in all cases ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between meditation and relaxation on distress and positive mood states over time .
RESULTS	Effect sizes for distress were large for both meditation and relaxation ( Cohen 's d = @ and @ , respectively ) , whereas the meditation group showed a larger effect size for positive states of mind than relaxation ( Cohen 's d = @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The meditation group also demonstrated significant pre-post decreases in both distractive and ruminative thoughts/behaviors compared with the control group ( p < @ in all cases ; Cohen 's d = @ for rumination and @ for distraction for the meditation group ) , with mediation models suggesting that mindfulness meditation 's effects on reducing distress were partially mediated by reducing rumination .
RESULTS	No significant effects were found for spiritual experience .
CONCLUSIONS	The data suggest that compared with a no-treatment control , brief training in mindfulness meditation or somatic relaxation reduces distress and improves positive mood states .
CONCLUSIONS	However , mindfulness meditation may be specific in its ability to reduce distractive and ruminative thoughts and behaviors , and this ability may provide a unique mechanism by which mindfulness meditation reduces distress .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the application of dynamic assessment in examining learning potential for adults with right hemisphere stroke and unilateral neglect .
METHODS	Forty adults with right cerebrovascular accident were randomly assigned to a control or dynamic group .
METHODS	Both groups were administered standard pretests and posttests of unilateral neglect .
METHODS	The dynamic group received cues , strategy training , and feedback during an object search task .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis of covariance indicated significant differences between groups on the object search task , with reduced unilateral neglect in the dynamic group .
RESULTS	Greater initiation of left-sided search , strategy use , and near and intermediate transfer of learning were observed in the dynamic group .
CONCLUSIONS	The brief dynamic assessment , developed for this study , provided an opportunity to observe the client 's ability to incorporate strategy training and feedback across visual search tasks .
CONCLUSIONS	This assessment approach has the potential to characterize learning profiles and to guide intervention decisions .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the effects of five-element music therapy on elderly patients with seasonal affective disorder in a Chinese nursing home .
METHODS	The patients ( n = @ ) were recruited from a Shijingshan district nursing home in Beijing , China .
METHODS	They were randomly assigned to two groups , a treatment group and a control group , with @ participants in each group .
METHODS	The patients received music therapy for @-@ h each week over an @-week period .
METHODS	The music therapy involved four phases : introduction , activities , listening to the Chinese five-element music , and a concluding phase .
METHODS	The participants in the control group did not listen to the five-element music .
METHODS	This study consisted of two parts : ( a ) a qualitative study that used focus groups to understand the feelings of the patients with seasonal affective disorder ; ( b ) a quantitative study that involved administration of the self-rating depression scale ( SDS ) and Hamilton depression scale ( HAMD ) before and after treatment .
RESULTS	( a ) Qualitative analysis results : strength derived from the five-element group music therapy and emotional adjustment .
RESULTS	The five-element group music therapy can reduce patients ' psychological distress and let them feel inner peace and enhance their life satisfaction .
RESULTS	( b ) No significant difference in SDS and HAMD scores was found between the two groups ( P > @ ) prior to treatment .
RESULTS	After treatment , the mean SDS score of the control group was @ + / - @ , while the treatment group 's score was @ + / - @ .
RESULTS	The HAMD score of the control group was @ + / -@ , and the treatment group 's score was @ + / - @ .
RESULTS	Following @ weeks of music therapy , the SDS and HAMD scores of the treatment group were significantly lower than those for the control group ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Five-element music therapy alleviated the symptoms of seasonal affective disorder in the elderly patients .

OBJECTIVE	The present report evaluates the effect of acute L-arginine administration on fetal heart variables by a computerized non-stress test ( NST ) analysis .
METHODS	Fifteen pregnant women at @-@ weeks of gestational age affected by mild to moderate gestational hypertension were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	The study was performed in the second and third days of hospitalization .
METHODS	Each woman received both active ( Arg ) or placebo treatment ( Placebo ) , in a double-blind , randomized , cross-over design .
METHODS	Women received saline infusion for @ min , then they were infused with either placebo ( saline infusion prepared by Damor Pharmaceutics and labeled as Arg-B ) or Arg ( L-Arg @ g/@ ml labeled as Arg-A ) .
RESULTS	Multiple analysis of variance ( MANOVA ) indicated that both placebo and Arg infusion were unable to affect cardiac variables and fetal movements .
RESULTS	As far as maternal blood pressure changes were concerned , MANOVA indicated that active treatment showed an acute hypotensive effect on both systolic ( F = @ , p < @ ) and diastolic values ( F = @ , p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Conversely , placebo infusion does not seems to have induced any change .
RESULTS	Considering each time of infusion we observed that Arg treatment was able to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure after the @ min of infusion , with this effect persisting for @ min .
CONCLUSIONS	These data indicate that the acute , intravenous administration of high-dose L-arginine does not induce significant changes in fetal heart rate ( FHR ) , whereas it lowers maternal blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	Such conclusions are reinforced by the observation that saline administration in the same pregnant women was neutral for both FHR and maternal blood pressure values .
CONCLUSIONS	According to previous studies , it seems conceivable that maternal L-arginine treatment enters the fetal circulation by crossing the placenta .
CONCLUSIONS	The lack of changes in FHR , however , suggests that no significant hemodynamic changes were induced by the treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Contrary to what happens in the mother , this may possibly be due to a low , if any , conversion of L-arginine to nitric oxide in the fetus .

###9491878
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of estrogen replacement therapy on cognitive functioning .
METHODS	The study consisted of two @-month treatment periods , one with estrogen and one with the placebo , in random order , separated by a @-month wash-out period .
METHODS	The study group comprised @ healthy postmenopausal women , aged @-@ years , with previous hysterectomy .
METHODS	Sixty-two women completed the study .
METHODS	Cognitive speed and accuracy , attention , and memory were evaluated .
METHODS	Serum estradiol ( E@ ) and FSH levels were controlled at the end of the estrogen , placebo , and wash-out periods .
RESULTS	Most of the cognitive tests correlated with age : older women were slower and made more errors than younger women .
RESULTS	Estrogen replacement therapy was not superior to the placebo in any test of cognitive performance .
RESULTS	In two out of ten visual detection tasks , recognition thresholds were longer with estrogen than with the placebo ( P < @ and P = @ ) .
RESULTS	On the most demanding test of working memory , the reaction times ( P = @ ) and error rates ( P = @ ) differed between treatments , yet this finding proved to be an effect of learning rather than treatment .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between cognitive performance and serum E@ levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Cognitive performance decreased with age .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-term estrogen replacement therapy did not provide any advantage over the placebo in terms of improving the performance .

BACKGROUND	Clinical data are lacking concerning concomitant administration of everolimus and tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients .
METHODS	In a prospective , multicenter , open-label , exploratory , randomized , @-month study , @ de novo renal transplant patients received everolimus , steroids , and basiliximab with low or standard tacrolimus exposure .
METHODS	The primary objective was to compare renal function at @ months after transplant .
RESULTS	Mean @-month serum creatinine ( primary safety variable ) was @ + / -@ micromol/L ( @ + / -@ mg/dL ) and @ + / -@ micromol/L ( @ + / -@ mg/dL ) in the low and standard tacrolimus groups , respectively , ( n.s. ) ; mean estimated GFR ( Nankivell ) was @ + / -@ mL/min and @ + / -@ mL/min ( n.s. ) .
RESULTS	Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred in @ patients : seven ( @ % ) in the low tacrolimus group and six ( @ % ) in the standard tacrolimus group , n.s.
RESULTS	One graft was lost in the standard tacrolimus group .
RESULTS	No patients died .
CONCLUSIONS	Tacrolimus exposure reduction in the presence of everolimus , steroids and basiliximab induction results in good efficacy in de novo renal transplant recipients with very well-preserved renal function .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional studies are warranted because between-group comparisons were limited by the relatively small differences in tacrolimus exposure in the @ arms ; trough levels were toward the upper end of the low-exposure ranges and toward the bottom of the standard-exposure ranges .

###22749632
OBJECTIVE	Previous analysis of this Intergroup trial demonstrated that with a median follow-up among surviving patients of @ months , the concurrent postoperative administration of cisplatin and radiation therapy improved local-regional control and disease-free survival of patients who had high-risk resectable head-and-neck carcinomas .
OBJECTIVE	With a minimum of @ years of follow-up potentially now available for all patients , these results are updated here to examine long-term outcomes .
METHODS	A total of @ analyzable patients who had high-risk resected head-and-neck cancers were prospectively randomized to receive either radiation therapy ( RT : @ Gy in @ weeks ) or identical RT plus cisplatin , @ mg/m ( @ ) i.v. on days @ , @ , and @ ( RT + CT ) .
RESULTS	At @ years , the local-regional failure rates were @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) , disease-free survival was @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) , and overall survival was @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) for patients treated by RT vs RT + CT , respectively .
RESULTS	In the unplanned subset analysis limited to patients who had microscopically involved resection margins and/or extracapsular spread of disease , local-regional failure occurred in @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) , disease-free survival was @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) , and overall survival was @ % vs @ % ( P = @ ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	At a median follow-up of @ years for surviving patients , no significant differences in outcome were observed in the analysis of all randomized eligible patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , analysis of the subgroup of patients who had either microscopically involved resection margins and/or extracapsular spread of disease showed improved local-regional control and disease-free survival with concurrent administration of chemotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	The remaining subgroup of patients who were enrolled only because they had tumor in @ or more lymph nodes did not benefit from the addition of CT to RT. .

OBJECTIVE	To study the progression-free survival ( PFS ) and toxicity with @ - or @-mg doses of temsirolimus ( CCI-@ ) after induction chemotherapy in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer .
METHODS	Patients with either stable or responding disease to four to six cycles of cisplatin or carboplatin plus etoposide or irinotecan were randomized between @ and @ weeks after completion of induction therapy to receive either @ or @ mg of temsirolimus intravenously every week until disease progression .
RESULTS	Eighty-seven patients entered between January @ and December @ , of whom @ were eligible : @ received @ mg ( arm A ) , and @ received @ mg ( arm B ) .
RESULTS	The overall median follow-up time for all eligible patients was @ months .
RESULTS	Median age was @ years ( range , @-@ ) ; @ ( @ % ) were male and @ ( @ % ) female ; @ % had brain metastases .
RESULTS	The overall median and @-year PFS were @ months ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] : @ , @ ) and @ % ( @ % CI : @ % , @ % ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The median PFS ( @ % CI ) for arm A was @ months ( @ , @ ) ; for arm B , it was @ months ( @ , @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median overall survival from randomization was @ months ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients with reported toxicities , @ ( @ % ) had grade @ toxicities , the most common of which were thrombocytopenia , hypophosphatemia , and fatigue , and an additional @ ( @ % ) had grade @ toxicities , the most common of which was neutropenia .
RESULTS	No patients experienced lethal toxicities .
CONCLUSIONS	Temsirolimus ( CCI @ ) , given at @ or @ mg weekly , seemed not to increase the PFS in this patient population .

###19187327
BACKGROUND	End-organ hyperreactivity is an important feature of the allergic airway .
BACKGROUND	There are no data directly comparing the responsiveness to treatment of different nasal provocation tests ( NPT ) .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the effect of levocetirizine on nasal adenosine @ ' - monophosphate ( AMP ) with specific allergen challenge in patients with intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis ( AR ) .
METHODS	Patients with AR were randomized in double-blind cross-over fashion to receive single doses of levocetirizine @ mg or identical placebo , with nasal challenge performed @ h after dosing .
METHODS	Sixteen participants completed per protocol .
METHODS	Nasal AMP or allergen challenge was conducted on separate days with @ - and @-week washout periods in between , respectively .
METHODS	Measurements of peak nasal inspiratory flow ( PNIF ) were made over @ min after each challenge .
METHODS	The primary end-point was the provocative concentration of AMP or allergen causing a @ % drop in the PNIF ( PC ( @ ) ) .
RESULTS	The time-profile for PNIF recovery [ area under the @ min time-response curve as % PNIF change ( min ) ] were significantly attenuated for AMP challenge , as mean difference [ @ % confidence interval ( CI ) ] : @ ( @ , @ ) , P = @ and for allergen challenge : @ ( @ , @ ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	A highly significant correlation was shown between methods for the area under the curve : ( R = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A statistically significant correlation was also seen for the PC ( @ ) : ( R = @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	PC ( @ ) improvement amounted to a @ ( @ % CI @ , @ ) and @ ( @ % CI -@ , @ ) doubling-dilution shifts for allergen and AMP challenges , respectively .
RESULTS	Bland-Altman plots confirmed good agreement between methods .
CONCLUSIONS	A high correlation and statistical agreement has been demonstrated between AMP and allergen challenge for all outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	In particular , the recovery profile after NPT is a sensitive and discriminatory measure of anti-allergic treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of rivastigmine ( @ to @ mg/day ) vs placebo over @ weeks in patients with traumatic brain injury and persistent cognitive impairment .
METHODS	This prospective , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study was conducted in @ patients at least @ months after injury .
METHODS	The primary efficacy measures were the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) Rapid Visual Information Processing ( RVIP ) A ' subtest and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT ) .
METHODS	The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of patients who demonstrated @ SD or greater improvement from baseline at week @ on CANTAB RVIP A ' or HVLT .
RESULTS	The percentage of responders at week @ on either the CANTAB RVIP A ' or HVLT was @ % for rivastigmine and @ % for placebo ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , for the overall study population , there were no significant differences for any of the secondary efficacy variables .
RESULTS	In a subgroup of patients with moderate to severe memory impairment ( n = @ ) , defined as @ % impairment or greater on HVLT at baseline , rivastigmine was significantly better than placebo for a number of measures , including the proportion of HVLT responders and CANTAB RVIP mean latency .
CONCLUSIONS	Rivastigmine was safe and well tolerated in patients with traumatic brain injury with cognitive deficits .
CONCLUSIONS	Rivastigmine shows promising results in the subgroup of patients with traumatic brain injury with moderate to severe memory deficits .

BACKGROUND	We developed and evaluated a comprehensive , ongoing intervention for families of schizophrenic patients appropriate for China 's complex family relationships and unique social environment .
METHODS	Sixty-three DSM-III-R schizophrenic patients living with family members were enrolled when admitted to hospital and randomly assigned to receive standard care or a family-based intervention that included monthly @-minute counselling sessions focused on the management of social and occupational problems , medication management , family education , family group meetings , and crisis intervention .
RESULTS	At @ , @ , and @-month follow-ups by blind evaluators , the proportion of subjects rehospitalised was lower , the duration of rehospitalisation was shorter , and the duration of employment was longer in the experimental group than in the control group ; these differences were statistically significant at the @ and @-month follow-ups and were not explained by differences in drug compliance .
RESULTS	Family intervention was associated with significantly lower levels of family burden .
CONCLUSIONS	This intervention is less costly than standard treatment , is suitable for urban families of schizophrenic patients in China and feasible given the constraints of the Chinese mental health system .

BACKGROUND	A number of stent-versus-stent trials have not been able to disclose differences in stent performance .
BACKGROUND	It has been hypothesized that the selection of patient subsets with simple lesion morphologies may have masked differences among the stent designs under testing .
BACKGROUND	The randomized Intracoronary Stenting and Angiographic Results Strut Thickness Effect on Restenosis Outcome ( ISAR-STEREO ) trial has shown that a reduced stent strut thickness is associated with a reduced risk for restenosis .
BACKGROUND	The rationale of this study was to investigate the role of lesion complexity on the capacity of a stent-versus-stent trial to distinguish between superior and inferior stents .
METHODS	In the ISAR-STEREO trial , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive either a thin-strut ( n = @ ) or a thick-strut stent ( n = @ ) with a comparable stent design .
METHODS	Restenosis , defined as a > or = @ % diameter stenosis at follow-up angiography , was analyzed according to the lesion complexity , which was assessed with the use of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association classification system .
RESULTS	The restenosis rate did not differ between stent designs in patients with noncomplex lesions ( type A or B ( @ ) ; restenosis rate : @ % vs @ % , P = @ for thin-strut vs thick-strut stents ) .
RESULTS	In patients with complex lesions ( type B@ or C ) , there was a significant reduction in restenosis in the thin-strut stent group ( restenosis rate : @ % vs @ % ; P < @ for thin-strut vs thick-strut stents ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that the potential to detect differences in the risk for restenosis in stent-versus-stent trials is strongly dependent on the inclusion of patients with complex lesions .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may be relevant when planning new stent-versus-stent trials .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this project was to evaluate the performance of a dentin adhesive system on carious and noncarious primary dentin in vivo .
METHODS	Forty-eight primary molars with carious lesions were randomly assigned to @ different treatments : group @ ( control , n = @ ) -- All identifiable , irreversibly infected dentin was removed prior to the application of the bonding agent and restorative material ; group @ ( experimental , n = @ ) -- Irreversibly infected dentin was partially removed prior to the application of the bonding agent and restorative material .
METHODS	The control and experimental teeth were clinically monitored every @ months and evaluated @ months after restoration .
METHODS	The teeth were extracted around the time of exfoliation and processed for scanning electron microscopy .
RESULTS	Retention rate , marginal integrity , and pulpal symptoms were identical in both groups .
RESULTS	Radiographically , the radiolucent area associated with the experimental restorations did not increase with time in @ % of the cases .
RESULTS	For the control group , the adhesive system formed a hybrid layer .
RESULTS	In the experimental group , there was morphologic evidence of the formation of an acid-resistant `` altered hybrid layer . ''
RESULTS	An acid-resistant tissue , resulting from the interdiffusion of adhesive resin within the area of carious dentin , was observed adjacent to and under the altered hybrid layer .
CONCLUSIONS	Application of an adhesive restorative system to irreversibly infected dentin did not affect the clinical performance of the restoration .

BACKGROUND	Fibre is often recommended as the first-choice treatment but its effects can be uneven .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the study was to compare the clinical efficacy and tolerability of fibre versus lactulose in outpatients with chronic constipation .
METHODS	In a prospective randomized crossover trial , patients were randomized to receive fibre or lactulose for four weeks .
METHODS	Between treatments , patients had at least one week free of laxatives .
RESULTS	@ patients , of median age @ years ( range , @-@ ) were recruited and @ patients completed the trial .
RESULTS	Compared to fibre , lactulose resulted in significantly higher mean bowel frequency ( @ , @ % CI @ to @ vs. @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) and stool consistency score ( @ , @ % CI @ to @ vs. @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Scores for ease of evacuation were similar .
RESULTS	The frequencies of adverse effects were not significantly different , but greater in the lactulose group .
RESULTS	Mean patients ' recorded improvement score was significantly higher after taking lactulose than fibre ( @ , @ % CI @ to @ vs. @ , @ % CI @ to @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who completed the trial , @ ( @ % ) preferred lactulose and @ ( @ % ) preferred fibre .
CONCLUSIONS	Lactulose had better efficacy than fibre for chronic constipation in ambulant patients , although both treatments were equally well tolerated in terms of adverse effects .

###19174719
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether the extensiveness of diabetic macular edema using a @-step scale based on optical coherence tomography explains pretreatment variation in visual acuity and predicts change in macular thickness or visual acuity after laser photocoagulation .
METHODS	Three hundred twenty-three eyes from a randomized clinical trial of two methods of laser photocoagulation for diabetic macular edema were studied .
METHODS	Baseline number of thickened optical coherence tomography subfields was used to characterize diabetic macular edema on a @-step scale from @ to @ .
METHODS	Associations were explored between baseline number of thickened subfields and baseline fundus photographic variables , visual acuity , central subfield mean thickness ( CSMT ) , and total macular volume .
METHODS	Associations were also examined between baseline number of thickened subfields and changes in visual acuity , CSMT , and total macular volume at @ and @ months after laser photocoagulation .
RESULTS	For baseline visual acuity , the number of thickened subfields explained no more variation than did CSMT , age and fluorescein leakage .
RESULTS	A greater number of thickened subfields was associated with a greater baseline CSMT , total macular volume , area of retinal thickening , and degree of thickening at the center of the macula ( r = @ , @ , @-@ @ , and @ , respectively ) and with a lower baseline visual acuity ( r = @ ) .
RESULTS	Baseline number of thickened subfields showed no association with change in visual acuity ( r < or = @-@ @ ) and weak associations with change in CSMT and total macular volume ( r from @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This optical coherence tomography based assessment of the extensiveness of diabetic macular edema did not explain additional variation in baseline visual acuity above that explained by other known important variables nor predict changes in macular thickness or visual acuity after laser photocoagulation .

###25156340
BACKGROUND	Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent in patients with stroke , but because revascularization does not improve major clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease relative to intensive medical therapy , routine evaluation for this disease is not warranted in stroke patients .
BACKGROUND	However , it might be warranted in patients destined to undergo vigorous physical therapy .
BACKGROUND	The Locomotor Experience Applied Post-Stroke study , a randomized controlled trial of @ participants that tested the relative efficacy of two rehabilitation techniques on functional walking level , provided the opportunity to address this question .
OBJECTIVE	The study aims to test the efficacy of screening for cardiovascular disease and an exercise tolerance test in assuring safety among patients undergoing vigorous rehabilitation for gait impairment .
METHODS	All participants were screened for serious cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions .
METHODS	At six-weeks poststroke , they also completed a cardiovascular screening inventory and underwent an exercise tolerance test involving bicycle ergometry .
METHODS	Participants received @ , @-min sessions of a prescribed physical therapy ( three per week ) , initiated at either two-months or six-months poststroke .
RESULTS	Twenty-nine participants were excluded on the basis of the cardiac screening questionnaire , and @ failed the exercise tolerance test for cardiovascular reasons .
RESULTS	No participant experienced a cardiac event during a treatment session .
RESULTS	Two participants experienced myocardial infarctions , but continued in the trial .
RESULTS	In three additional participants , myocardial infarctions caused or contributed to death .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of a negative cardiac screen and the absence of exercise tolerance test failure appeared to have a high negative predictive value for cardiac events during treatment , despite the likelihood of a high prevalence of coronary artery disease in our population .

OBJECTIVE	In a randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial , we compared the efficacy of oral dolasetron and ondansetron in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting in children after various surgical operations .
METHODS	Children were assigned randomly to one of three groups ( each contained @ children ) to receive dolasetron @ mg kg ( -@ ) or ondansetron @ mg kg ( -@ ) orally , or a placebo .
METHODS	All children received methylene blue capsules ( @ mg ) orally as an indicator before the induction of anaesthesia .
METHODS	Postoperatively , contamination of the mouth and the endotracheal tube by methylene blue was recorded , and postoperative nausea and vomiting was recorded for @-@ , @-@ and @-@ h. Metoclopramide ( @ mg kg ( -@ ) ) intravenously was used as the rescue antiemetic .
RESULTS	In the @-@ h period after operation , there were no differences between the groups .
RESULTS	In the @-@ h period , dolasetron was significantly better than placebo ( nausea @ versus @ % ; vomiting @ versus @ % ; total nausea and vomiting scores @ versus @ % ) .
RESULTS	Over the @-@ h period , both dolasetron and ondansetron were significantly better than placebo ( nausea @ versus @ versus @ % ) , vomiting ( @ versus @ versus @ % ) , and total nausea and vomiting scores ( @ versus @ versus @ % ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between dolasetron and ondansetron .
RESULTS	There was no important methylene blue contamination , and little use of rescue metoclopramide .
RESULTS	There were no important adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	Prophylactic oral dolasetron and ondansetron were effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting in children .

OBJECTIVE	To examine whether increased sleep during viral or bacterial infections supports host defense mechanisms .
METHODS	To test this assumption in humans , healthy male subjects were assigned either to sleep from @ to @ hours ( n = @ ) or to stay awake through the night ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	In the sleeping subjects Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin ( @ ng/kg ) or placebo were intravenously injected in balanced order during the first SWS episode .
METHODS	The age-matched , sleep-deprived subjects were injected at the same time point .
RESULTS	As expected , endotoxin significantly increased rectal temperature , the plasma levels of cortisol , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , the soluble TNF receptors p@ and p@ , Interleukin ( IL ) -@ , the IL-@ receptor antagonist ( RA ) , leukocyte , and granulocyte counts in both sleeping and sleep-deprived subjects , whereas lymphocyte and monocyte counts were transiently reduced .
RESULTS	Time courses of endotoxin-induced host responses did not differ between the sleep and sleep deprivation groups .
RESULTS	Endotoxin did not affect the amount of nocturnal wakefulness , nonrapid-eye-movement ( NREM ) sleep , or rapid-eye-movement ( REM ) sleep across the total night compared with placebo , but significantly increased electroencephalogram-arousals ( EEG-arousals ) in stage @ and decreased arousals in SWS .
RESULTS	In addition , the amount of SWS , spectral EEG-delta and - theta power was increased at the beginning and at the end of the sleep period , respectively , when the degree of immune activation was relatively low .
CONCLUSIONS	The present results support the notion that short-term sleep deprivation is unlikely to harm the immune system as far as unspecific acute responses are concerned .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects of endotoxin on sleep in this case support prior observations that in humans , enhanced SWS and intensified NREM sleep occur when host defense activation is subtle .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the ProSeal laryngeal mask airway ( PLMA ) and the standard laryngeal mask airway ( SLMA ) for intermittent positive pressure ventilation ( IPPV ) in a randomized auto control design .
METHODS	Fifty adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status @-@ , scheduled for elective plastic surgery under general anesthesia were recruited .
METHODS	After the routine intravenous anesthesia induction , the PLMA and the SLMA were inserted randomly in sequence into each patient and inflated to an intracuff pressure of @ cm H ( @ ) O ( @ cm H ( @ ) O = @ kPa ) , airway seal pressure and lung ventilation satisfaction were evaluated , and fiberoptic ( FOB ) scores of the cuff anatomic position were measured .
METHODS	The mean expired volume and the mean peak inspiratory pressure of five continuous breaths were calculated after IPPV with @ ml/kg tidal volume was performed .
RESULTS	Without cuff inflation , airway seal pressure was higher with the PLMA than with the SLMA ( P < @ ) , and adequate or acceptable lung ventilation was obtained in @ ( @ % ) patients with the PLMA , but only @ ( @ % ) patients with the SLMA .
RESULTS	When the air volume required to obtain an intracuff pressure of @ cm H ( @ ) O , adequate lung ventilation was obtained in @ patients with the PLMA , but only @ patients with the SLMA , and the inflation volume and sequential airway seal pressure were higher with the PLMA than with the SLMA ( both P < @ ) , and the airway seal pressure with the PLMA was not less than with the SLMA in each patient .
RESULTS	The ventilation volume was higher with the PLMA than with the SLMA , except in @ patients .
RESULTS	The FOB score of the cuff position was lower with the PLMA than with the SLMA ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean expired tidal volume and the mean peak inspiratory pressure were not significantly different between @ patients with the PLMA and @ patients with the SLMA for airway maintenance during operation ( both P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with SLMA , PLMA can achieve a higher airway seal pressure and potentially isolate the glottis and the upper esophagus , and is safer and more effective for positive pressure ventilation .

###23594808
OBJECTIVE	In recent years cross-linked polyethylenes have been developed in an attempt to reduce the wear , as has been demonstrated in knee simulators .
OBJECTIVE	The aim is to assess , by counting particles of polyethylene in synovial fluid , whether the reduction in wear is confirmed in patients with a highly crosslinked polyethylene prosthesis .
METHODS	A prospective randomised study was designed .
METHODS	During the implantation of a knee prosthesis , one group of patients was assigned the use of a conventional polyethylene ( group A ) , and the other group a highly crosslinked polyethylene ( X@ , Stryker Orthopaedics ) ( group B ) .
METHODS	At @ months after surgery a knee arthrocentesis was performed , and the number of polyethylene particles was counted in a scanning electron microscopy .
METHODS	Fourteen samples from each group were studied .
RESULTS	Both groups were comparable in all study variables .
RESULTS	We found no significant differences in the concentration of polyethylene particles/ml ( @ @ million in group A vs @ @ million in group B , P = @ ) or the total number of isolated particles .
RESULTS	We found no differences either in size or morphology of particles between both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Although several in vitro studies in vitro using different types of highly crosslinked polyethylene found a significant reduction , we did not find that that wear was reduced in the knees of these patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The great variability in the number of particles between individuals suggests that polyethylene wear in vivo depends on many factors , so perhaps the type of polyethylene is not the most significant factor .

OBJECTIVE	To estimate the protection against death provided by vaccination against influenza .
METHODS	Prospective cohort follow up supplemented by weekly national counts of influenza confirmed in the community .
METHODS	Primary care .
METHODS	@,@ patients aged over @ years from @ general practices in Great Britain .
METHODS	Death .
RESULTS	In unvaccinated members of the cohort daily all cause mortality was strongly associated with an index of influenza circulating in the population ( mortality ratio @ , @ % confidence interval @ to @ at @th centile of circulating influenza ) .
RESULTS	The association was strongest for respiratory deaths but was also present for cardiovascular deaths .
RESULTS	In contrast , in vaccinated people mortality from any cause was not associated with circulating influenza .
RESULTS	The difference in patterns between vaccinated and unvaccinated people could not easily be due to chance ( P = @ , all causes ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study , using a novel and robust approach to control for confounding , provides robust evidence of a protective effect on mortality of vaccination against influenza .

OBJECTIVE	To analyse the prospect of memory training for patients with organic brain damage .
METHODS	Sixty-two patients with memory disorder were assigned to three different groups : a control group ( n = @ ) with low dose memory training , a process oriented memory training group ( POT ) ( n = @ ) and a group ( ST ) who was taught to compensate for memory problems with different strategies ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Most of the patients had suffered a stroke .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria were medium to weak memory impairment defined by the patients ' performance in the California Verbal Learning Test .
METHODS	Patients with complete amnesia were excluded .
METHODS	Specific care was taken that the groups did not differ in age , time since illness , duration of rehabilitation effort , verbal and performance IQ , memory and attention performance .
METHODS	The two treatment groups received @ hours memory training , the low dose memory training control group @ sessions .
RESULTS	The treatment groups improved in verbal and prospective memory , but only the group with POT experienced a significant improvement compared with the control group .
RESULTS	Training effects were specific , i. e. they affected verbal memory , but were not encapsulated , i. e. generalized to the recall of prose passages and of appointments .
RESULTS	The POT group also showed a statistically weak outperformance compared with the ST group and some attentional improvement as well .
CONCLUSIONS	Memory training is effective in patients with organic brain lesion , but only if applied frequently .
CONCLUSIONS	Comparing the two training high intensity treatments , a POT focus seems to be superior to teaching a set of compensation strategies .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies suggest that MTG could be mobilized through lifestyle interventions .
BACKGROUND	We assessed influences of moderate dietary weight loss in non diabetic obese and overweight women on MTG content and cardiac function .
METHODS	We selected a subgroup of @ women from the B-SMART study population .
METHODS	The B-SMART study compared weight loss and associated metabolic and cardiovascular markers with reduced-carbohydrate and reduced-fat hypocaloric diets .
METHODS	Selected subjects had completed a cardiac magnetic resonance ( MR ) scan including imaging and proton spectroscopy to assess cardiac structure and function as well as MTG content .
RESULTS	An average weight reduction of @ @ kg at six months was associated with a relative decrease of MTG of @ % ( from @ @ % at baseline to @ @ % at follow-up , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The response was similar with carbohydrate and fat restriction .
RESULTS	Diastolic function expressed as ratio of peak filling rate in E - and A-Phase ( PFRE/PFRA ) was unchanged .
RESULTS	Reductions of left atrial size ( from @ @ cm ( @ ) to @ @ cm ( @ ) , p = @ ) , the normalized ratio of PFRE and early diastolic lengthening velocity PLV ( from @ @ to @ @ , p < @ ) and fat free mass ( from @ @ kg to @ @ kg , p = @ ) reflected altered cardiac volume loading after diet , but did not correlate to MTG content .
CONCLUSIONS	Moderate dietary weight loss significantly reduced MTG content in women with uncomplicated overweight or obesity .
CONCLUSIONS	Macronutrient composition of the diet did not significantly affect the extent of MTG reduction .

BACKGROUND	In patients with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , combined treatment with several agents may increase the effectiveness of antiviral therapy .
BACKGROUND	We studied the safety and efficacy of saquinavir , an HIV-protease inhibitor , given with one or two nucleoside antiretroviral agents , as compared with the safety and efficacy of a combination of two nucleosides alone .
METHODS	In this double-blind trial , patients with HIV infection were randomly assigned to receive either saquinavir ( @ mg per day ) plus both zidovudine ( @ mg per day ) and zalcitabine ( @ mg per day ) or zidovudine plus either saquinavir or zalcitabine .
METHODS	The @ patients enrolled had CD@ + counts of @ to @ cells per cubic millimeter and had previously received zidovudine for a median of @ months .
METHODS	The study lasted @ weeks , with an optional double-blind extension period of an additional @ to @ weeks .
RESULTS	Ninety-six percent of the patients completed the @-week study .
RESULTS	In all three treatment groups , CD@ + cell counts rose at first and then fell gradually .
RESULTS	The normalized area under the curve for the CD@ + count was greater with the three-drug combination than with either saquinavir and zidovudine ( P = @ ) or zalcitabine and zidovudine ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were significantly greater reductions in plasma HIV with the three-drug combination than with the other regimens when peripheral-blood mononuclear cells were cultured for HIV and HIV RNA was assessed , and there were greater decreases in serum neopterin and beta@-microglobulin levels .
RESULTS	There were no major differences in toxic effects among the three treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with saquinavir , zalcitabine , and zidovudine was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	This drug combination reduced HIV-@ replication , increased CD@ + cell counts , and decreased levels of activation markers in serum more than did treatment with zidovudine and either saquinavir or zalcitabine .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies are warranted to evaluate whether the three-drug combination will reduce morbidity and mortality .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the neurotoxicity and ototoxicity of combination cisplatin plus paclitaxel versus cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide using extensive clinical and instrumental evaluation .
METHODS	Forty-six of @ consecutive patients affected by-epithelial ovarian cancer seen in our institution between October @ and August @ entered the study .
METHODS	After randomization , they were assigned to receive cisplatin @ mg/m@ every @ weeks associated with cyclophosphamide @ mg/m@ ( CC group , n = @ ) or paclitaxel @ mg/m@ over a @-hour infusion ( CP group , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Treatment was repeated six times in @ patients and nine times in @ .
METHODS	Before treatment and after three , six , and nine courses of chemotherapy , patients underwent clinical and instrumental neurologic and otologic examinations .
RESULTS	Mild sensory impairment was evident even after only three courses of both treatments and signs and symptoms were more severe at the end of treatment .
RESULTS	On clinical grounds only , it was possible to demonstrate after six and nine courses a difference between CC and CP treatment , due to the involvement in some CP patients of pain and thermal sensory modalities .
RESULTS	However , the overall severity of the neuropathy was similar .
RESULTS	Audiometric parameters demonstrated a more negative outcome after treatment in CC compared with CP patients .
RESULTS	However , the different severity of the involvement was closely correlated to this initial difference in audiologic performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Up to nine courses of chemotherapy , the CC and CP schedules are similar in terms of severity of neurotoxicity and ototoxicity when patients are evaluated during and immediately after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	With the doses used in our study , these toxicities are not dose-limiting .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that most of the toxic effects observed during the treatment were due to cisplatin .

BACKGROUND	Characterization of fatal and non-fatal reactions to food indicates that the majority of reactions are due to the ingestion of prepared foods rather than the non-processed allergen .
BACKGROUND	In an ongoing study that used a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to investigate peanut allergy and clinical symptoms , the observed reaction severity in four of the first six subjects was greater than anticipated .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that this was due to differences in the composition of the challenge vehicle .
OBJECTIVE	The aim was to investigate whether the severity of observed challenge reactions would be repeated on re-challenge with a lower fat challenge vehicle .
METHODS	Peanut-allergic subjects were re-challenged with a lower fat recipe after reacting more severely than was anticipated to an initial peanut challenge .
METHODS	Similar challenge vehicle recipes were used , the only difference being the lower fat content ( @ % compared with @ % ) .
METHODS	The peanut content of the two recipes was analysed using RAST inhibition studies and ELISA tests .
RESULTS	Three of four subjects reacted to much smaller doses of peanut protein on re-challenge ( mean dose equivalence - @ times less peanut ) with the lower fat recipe .
RESULTS	RAST inhibition showed that neither recipe altered epitope recognition .
RESULTS	The higher fat recipe required twice as much peanut to cause @ % inhibition .
RESULTS	ELISA detected far lower levels of peanut in the higher fat recipe ( @ @ parts per million ( p.p.m. ) ) than in the lower fat recipe ( @ @ p.p.m. ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The fat content of a challenge vehicle has a profound effect on the reaction experienced after allergen ingestion .
CONCLUSIONS	This is another factor to be considered in assessing the risk of certain foods to food-allergic consumers and adds another dimension to clinical , research and regulatory practice .

BACKGROUND	Despite the availability of an increasing array of empirically validated adolescent drug abuse prevention programs , program materials and evaluation findings are poorly disseminated .
BACKGROUND	CD-ROM and the Internet hold promise for disseminating this information to schools and agencies that directly serve youth , and to policy-making bodies that exercise control over funds to support adolescent drug abuse prevention programming .
BACKGROUND	However , data on the relative efficacy of these newer technologies over conventional print means of dissemination are lacking .
METHODS	Recruited through schools , community agencies , and policy-making bodies , @ professionals were randomized to receive prevention program materials via pamphlets ( @ participants ) , CD-ROM ( @ participants ) , and the Internet ( @ participants ) .
METHODS	Participants completed pretest , posttest , and @-month follow-up measures that assessed their access to prevention program materials ; self-efficacy for identifying , obtaining , and recommending these programs ; and their likelihood of requesting , implementing , and recommending prevention programs to their constituents .
RESULTS	Participants exposed to dissemination via CD-ROM and the Internet evidenced the greatest short - and long-term gains on accessibility , self-efficacy , and behavioral intention variables .
CONCLUSIONS	CD-ROM and the Internet are viable means for disseminating adolescent drug abuse prevention programs to schools , community agencies , and policy-making bodies , and should be increasingly used for dissemination purposes .

OBJECTIVE	It has been shown by many authors that proprioception declines with age .
OBJECTIVE	However , few studies have examined the effects of exercise interventions on proprioception .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a creative dance program on proprioception of older adults .
METHODS	Thirty-seven men and women between @ and @ years of age , who were not engaged in any exercise program for at least one year , were randomly assigned to an experimental ( @ + or - @ years ) or a control group ( @ + or - @ years ) .
METHODS	The experimental group participated in a creative dance program for @ weeks with a periodicity of @ sessions of @ minutes per week .
METHODS	Measures of knee kinesthesia , knee joint position sense and arm positioning were taken before and after the program .
RESULTS	After @ weeks , knee joint position sense ( P = @ ) knee kinesthesia ( in flexion ) ( P = @ ) , and arm positioning ( P = @ ) significantly improved within the creative dance training group .
RESULTS	At @ weeks follow-up , arm positioning performance was significantly better for the creative dance group when compared with the control group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The control group did not show any significant improvement in proprioception .
CONCLUSIONS	This study showed that a creative dance program emphasising body awareness can improve proprioception in older adults .

OBJECTIVE	Risk prediction is important in medical management , especially to optimize patient management before surgical intervention .
OBJECTIVE	No quantitative risk scores or predictors are available for patients with peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) .
OBJECTIVE	Surgical risk and prognosis are usually based on anesthetic scores or clinical evaluation .
OBJECTIVE	We suggest that renal function is a better predictor of risk than other cardiovascular parameters .
OBJECTIVE	This study used the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease ( MDRD-@ ) - calculated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) to compare classical cardiovascular risk factors with prognosis and cardiovascular events of hospitalized PAD patients .
METHODS	The study evaluated @ patients who were admitted for vascular intervention and diagnosed with grade IIb , III , or IV PAD or with carotid or renal stenosis .
METHODS	Those with carotid or renal stenosis were excluded , leaving @ patients who were randomized from @ to @ and monitored until @ .
METHODS	We performed a life-table analysis with a @-year follow-up period and one final checkpoint .
METHODS	The following risk factors were evaluated : age , sex , ischemic heart disease , ictus ( as a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease related to systemic arterial disease ) , diabetes , arterial hypertension , dyslipidemia , smoking , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , type of vascular intervention , and urea and creatinine plasma levels .
METHODS	The GFR was calculated using the MDRD-@ equation .
METHODS	Death , major cardiovascular events , and reintervention for arterial disease were recorded during the follow-up .
RESULTS	Patients ( @ % men ) were a mean age of @ @ ( standard deviation ) years .
RESULTS	PAD grade IIb was diagnosed in @ ( @ % ) and grade III-IV in @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Forty-two minor amputations ( @ % ) , @ major amputations ( @ % ) , and @ revascularizations ( @ % ) were performed .
RESULTS	A major cardiovascular event occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) , and @ ( @ % ) died .
RESULTS	Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the MDRD-@ GFR , age , and male sex were independent variables related to death and that the MDRD-@ GFR and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were related to major cardiovascular events .
RESULTS	A statistically significant relationship was also found between serum creatinine levels and reintervention rates .
CONCLUSIONS	The MDRD-@ GFR was a better predictor of risk of death or infarction than classical cardiovascular risk factors in patients with PAD .
CONCLUSIONS	This suggests that its routine use in the initial evaluation in patients with PAD is beneficial .

BACKGROUND	Propofol is reported to reduce both sympathetic and parasympathetic tone ; however , it is not clear whether the changes in heart rate variability are associated with depth of anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	The purposes of the present study were ( @ ) to evaluate the changes in heart rate variability at different depths of hypnosis and ( @ ) to compare the effects of propofol on heart rate variability with that of sevoflurane .
METHODS	Thirty patients were randomly allocated into the propofol or sevoflurane for induction of anesthesia .
METHODS	The depth of hypnosis was monitored by the Bispectral Index ( BIS ) .
METHODS	Spectral analysis of heart rate variability using a maximum-entropy method resulted in a characteristic power spectrum with two main regions , a high frequency ( HF ) and a low frequency ( LF ) .
METHODS	Hemodynamics , entropy , LF , HF , and LF/HF were monitored when the patients were awake and after induction of anesthesia .
RESULTS	Both propofol and sevoflurane decreased blood pressure in a BIS-dependent manner , whereas heart rate showed no significant changes during the study period .
RESULTS	In the propofol group , entropy and HF decreased with a reduction in the BIS value .
RESULTS	Although LF decreased after induction of anesthesia , propofol caused no further decrease in LF in spite of a reduction in the BIS value .
RESULTS	In the sevoflurane group , LF decreased with a reduction in the BIS value .
RESULTS	Entropy and HF decreased after induction of anesthesia ( BIS at @ ) ; however , no further decreases were observed in spite of a reduction in the BIS value .
CONCLUSIONS	Induction of anesthesia with propofol decreased blood pressure , entropy , and HF in a BIS-dependent manner , indicating that propofol reduces cardiac parasympathetic tone depending on the depth of hypnosis .
CONCLUSIONS	Conversely , sevoflurane did not show the BIS-dependent decreases in heart rate , blood pressure , HF , and entropy , indicating that sevoflurane has little or no effect on cardiac parasympathetic tone .

BACKGROUND	A variety of factors , including the number of defibrillation electrodes and shocking capacitance , may influence the defibrillation efficacy of an implantable defibrillator system .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , the purpose of this study was to compare the defibrillation energy requirement using a @ uF two-electrode defibrillation system and a @ uF three-electrode defibrillation system .
RESULTS	The defibrillation energy requirements measured with both systems were compared in @ consecutive patients .
RESULTS	The two-electrode system used a single transvenous lead with two defibrillation coils in conjunction with a biphasic waveform from a @ uF capacitor .
RESULTS	The three-electrode system used the same transvenous lead , utilized a pectoral implantable defibrillator generator shell as a third electrode , and delivered the identical biphasic waveform from a @ uF capacitor .
RESULTS	The two-electrode system was associated with a higher defibrillation energy requirement ( @ + / - @ J ) than was the three-electrode system ( @ + / - @ J , p < @ ) , however , the leading edge voltage was not significantly different between systems ( @ + / - @ V vs. @ + / - @ V , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The two-electrode system also had a higher shocking resistance ( @ + / - @ ohms vs. @ + / - @ ohms , p < @ ) and a lower peak current ( @ + / - @ A vs. @ + / - @ A , p < @ ) than the three-electrode system .
CONCLUSIONS	A three-electrode defibrillation system that utilizes a dual coil transvenous lead and a subcutaneous pectoral electrode with lower capacitance is associated with a lower defibrillation energy requirement than is a dual coil defibrillation system with higher capacitance .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding suggests that the utilization of a pectoral generator as a defibrillation electrode in conjunction with smaller capacitors is a more effective defibrillation system and may allow for additional miniaturization of implantable defibrillators .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the influence of different ways of blood transfusion on the expression levels of interleukins ( IL ) and tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) inperi-operative patients with esophageal cancer .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with esophageal cancer who underwent radical operations were selected as study patients and randomly divided into an observation group ( treated with autologous blood transfusion ) and control group ( with homologous blood transfusion ) .
METHODS	Changes of intra-operative indexes and peri-operative blood indexes , from hemoglobin ( Hb ) and hematocrit value ( Hct ) , to levels of inflammatory factors like interleukins-@ ( IL-@ ) , IL-@ , IL-@ and tumor necrosis factor - ( TNF - ) were compared .
RESULTS	Operations for patients in both groups were successfully conducted , and no significant differences in mean surgical duration and intra-operative hemorrhage volume , fluid infusion volume and blood transfusion volume were detected ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with values before surgery , Hb and Hct levels decreased significantly while white blood cell count ( WBC ) increased @ , @ and @ d after operation ( p < @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , WBC was apparently higher in observation group than in control group @ and @ d after operation ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with before surgery , in the observation group , levels of IL-@ , IL-@ and IL-@ had no significant differences after operation ( P > @ ) , but TNF - level increased y ( p < @ ) , whereas in control group , IL-@ level had no significant difference ( p > @ ) , IL-@ level decreased obviously ( p < @ ) , IL-@ level increased markedly first and then decreased gradually as time passed but its level remained elevated ( p < @ ) , and TNF - level increased first and then decreased , and there was no significant difference @ d after operation ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreased IL-@ and increased IL-@ levels are two important reasons forimmunosuppression after homologous blood transfusion , whereas autologous blood transfusion can alleviate this while increasing the TNF - level , which also has potential to improve anti-tumor immunity in the human body .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of low - ( @ mg ) or high - ( @ mg ) dose atorvastatin on carotid artery distensibility in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery disease using carotid magnetic resonance imaging .
METHODS	Eighteen patients underwent initial @-dimensional ECG gated-phase contrast carotid MR imaging and off-line applanation tonometry for distensibility assessment before randomisation to receive low - or high-dose statins and this was repeated at @ weeks .
METHODS	Phase and magnitude images from the @-D phase contrast acquisitions were used for quantification of distensibility and compliance coefficients and were compared between the low - and high-dose statin groups .
RESULTS	Both groups were comparable with regards to their demographics , co-morbidities and baseline cholesterol levels .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of high-dose statin administration , a significant decrease in LDL ( p = @ ) and CRP ( p = @ ) was observed .
RESULTS	At @ weeks , the distensibility coefficient of the common and internal carotid artery was found to be significantly higher ( with respect to baseline ) in the high-dose group ( p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The compliance coefficient was likewise found to be raised in the high-dose group when compared with the low-dose group [ common carotid ( p = @ ) , internal carotid ( p = @ ) ] .
CONCLUSIONS	High-dose atorvastatin tends to reduce carotid arterial stiffness , as suggested by increased distensibility and compliance coefficients ; however , these results need validation through large-scale trials to fully establish their possible use in clinical practice .

BACKGROUND	Postlaparoscopic shoulder pain ( PLSP ) frequently occurs after various laparoscopic surgical procedures .
BACKGROUND	Its mechanism is commonly assumed to be overstretching of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers due to the pressure of a pneumoperitoneum , which causes phrenic nerve-mediated referred pain to the shoulder .
BACKGROUND	Based on this hypothesis , we speculated that during inspiration , the lung could squeeze out the phrenic nerve with carbon dioxide gas against the constantly pressurized abdominal cavity with increasing tidal volume ( V ( T ) ) .
BACKGROUND	Thus , we examined whether mechanical ventilation with a low V ( T ) ( LTV , V ( T ) @ ml/kg ) during a pneumoperitoneum might reduce PLSP in patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy compared with ventilation with the traditional V ( T ) ( TTV , V ( T ) @ ml/kg ) .
METHODS	In a prospective trial , @ adult patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy were randomly assigned to two groups of @ each ( LTV and TTV groups ) .
METHODS	Intravenous ketorolac was used as a postoperative rescue analgesic .
METHODS	The @ - , @ - , @ - , and @-h postoperative incidence and severity of PLSP , severity of surgical pain , and need for rescue analgesia was assessed .
RESULTS	The overall incidence of PLSP was similar in both groups ( @ % in the LTV group vs. @ % in the TTV group ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the TTV group , the incidence and PLSP verbal rating scale ( VRS ) did not decrease in the LTV group throughout the study period .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences were observed in the VRS surgical pain score , the cumulative ketorolac consumption at each time point , or the time to first rescue analgesia .
CONCLUSIONS	Mechanical ventilation with a reduced @ ml/kg V ( T ) during a pneumoperitoneum does not reduce the frequency and severity of PLSP after laparoscopic appendectomy compared with ventilation with the traditional V ( T ) ( @ ml/kg ) .

BACKGROUND	Few studies have evaluated IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to melon with details of clinical reactions confirmed by double-blind , placebo-controlled , food challenges ( DBPCFCs ) .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to investigate clinical features ( type and severity of reactions , age at onset , results of skin prick and in vitro tests , and incidence of other allergic diseases and associated food allergies ) of acute allergic reactions to melon confirmed by DBPCFCs .
METHODS	Fifty-three consecutive adult patients complaining of adverse reactions to melon were included in the study .
METHODS	Skin prick tests and detection of specific IgE were performed in all patients with melon , avocado , kiwi , banana , chestnut , latex , pollen , and other offending foods .
METHODS	Patients first underwent an open food challenge , unless they had a convincing history of severe anaphylaxis .
METHODS	Positive open food challenge reactions were subsequently evaluated by DBPCFCs .
RESULTS	Actual clinical reactivity was confirmed in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients .
RESULTS	The most frequent symptom was oral allergy syndrome ( n = @ ) , but two patients experienced life-threatening reactions , including respiratory symptoms and hypotension .
RESULTS	The positive predictive value for a skin prick test was @ % , and that for specific IgE measurement was @ % .
RESULTS	Forty-five reactions to @ other foods were confirmed in @ patients .
RESULTS	The most common foods associated with melon allergy were avocado ( n = @ ) , banana ( n = @ ) , kiwi ( n = @ ) , watermelon ( n = @ ) , and peach ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Onset of melon-induced allergic symptoms occurred from @ to @ years ( median , @ years ) , preceded by seasonal rhinitis , asthma , or both in @ % ( @/@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	About one third of reported reactions to melon are confirmed by means of DBPCFC , which has been proven to be the most reliable procedure in the diagnosis of clinical fruit allergy .
CONCLUSIONS	Isolated melon allergy is rare , with most patients either having allergic rhinitis , asthma , or both and associated food allergies .

BACKGROUND	Patients undergoing rehabilitation after thromboembolic stroke have a relatively high incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) .
BACKGROUND	Warfarin , with a target international normalized ratio ( INR ) of @-@ @ is effective for the prevention of VTE .
BACKGROUND	However , because stroke is a major risk factor for bleeding with warfarin , a less intense regimen ( target INR < @ ) , might safely prevent VTE in stroke rehabilitation patients .
METHODS	This study was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of @ mg of warfarin in patients undergoing rehabilitation following completed stroke .
METHODS	The major efficacy endpoint was symptomatic , objectively proven VTE or asymptomatic VTE detected by monthly duplex ultrasonography ( DU ) of the proximal leg veins or mandatory bilateral contrast venography performed at the end of the study .
METHODS	The major safety endpoint was bleeding .
RESULTS	There were @ patients screened for enrollment , @ had one or more exclusion criterion , and @ had previously undetected proximal DVT on admission .
RESULTS	Of the @ eligible and consenting patients , @ received warfarin and @ received placebo .
RESULTS	Of the randomized patients , @ had successful venography ( @ warfarin and @ placebo ) .
RESULTS	In the warfarin group , three ( @ % ) patients had DVT and one ( @ % ) had proximal DVT whereas in the placebo group , seven ( @ % ) had DVT and five ( @ % ) had proximal DVT .
RESULTS	The risk ratio for any DVT in warfarin-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients was @ ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	For proximal DVT , the risk ratio was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	No patients suffered major bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	A fixed dose of @ mg of warfarin per day in patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation is safe and associated with a relative risk reduction of about @ % in the incidence of proximal DVT and @ % in overall DVT .

BACKGROUND	Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase ( TIMPs ) have at least @ different functions .
BACKGROUND	They inhibit the catalytic activity of matrix metalloproteinases , and they act as growth factors .
METHODS	Pretreatment ethylenediamine tetracetic acid plasma TIMP-@ was assayed from @ patients who were enrolled in a Phase III , second-line , hormone therapy trial , and from a control group of @ healthy , postmenopausal women by using the TIMP-@ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
RESULTS	The plasma TIMP-@ levels from the postmenopausal control group ( n = @ women ) were @ + / - @ ng/mL mean + / - standard deviation ( range , @-@ ng/mL ) .
RESULTS	The upper limit of normal was defined as the mean + / - @ standard deviations of the control group ( @ ng/mL ) .
RESULTS	Patient pretreatment plasma TIMP-@ levels ranged from @ ng/mL to @ ng/mL .
RESULTS	Plasma TIMP-@ was elevated above the mean + @ standard deviations of the control group ( @ ng/mL ) in @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	In univariate analysis , patients who had elevated versus normal plasma TIMP-@ levels had a reduced clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The time to progression ( TTP ) ( @ days vs @ days ; P < @ ) and overall survival ( @ days vs @ days ; P = @ ) also were significantly shorter in patients who had elevated TIMP-@ levels .
RESULTS	TTP and overall survival also were significantly shorter in patients who had higher TIMP-@ plasma levels when it was analyzed as a continuous variable .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , elevated plasma TIMP-@ level remained a prognostic factor for reduced overall survival ( P < @ ) along with elevated serum HER-@ / neu ( P < @ ) and the presence of visceral metastases ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated pretreatment plasma levels of TIMP-@ predicted a decreased response to second-line hormone therapy and reduced survival in women with metastatic breast cancer .

BACKGROUND	Recent studies provide evidence for the effectiveness of Internet-based maintenance treatments for mental disorders .
BACKGROUND	However , it is still unclear which participants might or might not profit from this particular kind of treatment delivery .
OBJECTIVE	The study aimed to identify moderators of treatment outcome in a transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment ( TIMT ) offered to patients after inpatient psychotherapy for mental disorders in routine care .
METHODS	Using data from a randomized controlled trial ( N = @ ) designed to test the effectiveness of TIMT , we performed secondary analyses to identify factors moderating the effects of TIMT ( intervention ) when compared with those of a treatment-as-usual control condition .
METHODS	TIMT involved an online self-management module , asynchronous patient-therapist communication , a peer support group , and online-based progress monitoring .
METHODS	Participants in the control condition had unstructured access to outpatient psychotherapy , standardized outpatient face-to-face continuation treatment , and psychotropic management .
METHODS	Self-reports of psychopathological symptoms and potential moderators were assessed at the start of inpatient treatment ( T@ ) , at discharge from inpatient treatment/start of TIMT ( T@ ) , and at @-month ( T@ ) and @-month follow-up ( T@ ) .
RESULTS	Education level , positive outcome expectations , and diagnoses significantly moderated intervention versus control differences regarding changes in outcomes between T@ and T@ .
RESULTS	Only education level moderated change differences between T@ and T@ .
RESULTS	The effectiveness of the intervention ( vs control ) was more pronounced among participants with a low ( vs high ) education level ( T@-T@ : B = -@ , SE @ , P = @ ; T@-T@ : B = -@ , SE @ , P = @ ) , participants with high ( vs low ) positive outcome expectations ( T@-T@ : B = -@ , SE @ , P = @ ) and participants with anxiety disorder ( vs mood disorder ) ( T@-T@ : B = -@ , SE @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Simple slope analyses revealed that despite some subgroups benefiting less from the intervention than others , all subgroups still benefited significantly .
CONCLUSIONS	This transdiagnostic Internet-based maintenance treatment might be suitable for a wide range of participants differing in various clinical , motivational , and demographic characteristics .
CONCLUSIONS	The treatment is especially effective for participants with low education levels .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may generalize to other Internet-based maintenance treatments .

BACKGROUND	Droperidol even in low doses such as @ mg to @ mg can increase postoperative anxiety and state of tension .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to determine whether these side effects occur frequently following low-dose droperidol and to see whether these are dose related .
METHODS	@ female in - and outpatients ASA grade @ and @ undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy were recruited to this prospective , double-blind study .
METHODS	General anaesthesia was standardized ( induction with thiopentone , fentanyl @ micrograms/kg and vecuronium @ mg/kg , tracheal intubation , maintainance with enflurane in N@O/O@ ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated to receive saline ( n = @ ) , @ mg ( n = @ ) , @ mg ( n = @ ) or @ mg ( n = @ ) droperidol i.v. @ minutes before the end of surgery .
METHODS	@,@,@ , and @ hours postoperatively , the patients ' anxiety , state of tension and overall mood was evaluated using two psychological questionnaires which had been tested for the perioperative period ( Erlanger anxiety and tension-scale/BSKE-EWL-test ) .
METHODS	Sedation was evaluated by the staff of the recovery room .
METHODS	In addition , postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV ) was assessed using a @ mm visual analogue scale and by counting the episodes of retching or vomiting .
METHODS	PONV was then rated over the whole observation period as none , mild , moderate or severe using a fixed scoring algorithm .
METHODS	Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA and the chi@-test .
RESULTS	The patients did not differ with regard to biometric data , duration of surgery and anaesthesia .
RESULTS	The postoperative scores for anxiety , state of tension and overall mood were not different between the groups at any observation time ( Fig. @ : anxiety and tension : P = @ ; figure @ : overall mood : P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Quality of sleep in the first night after surgery was the same in all groups ( Table @ and @ ) .
RESULTS	Sedation was not significantly different ( Table @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , duration of stay in the recovery room did not differ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	On the other hand , three patients from the @ mg droperidol group had to stay unexpectedly on the ward overnight , because they had been too much sedated to be discharged at home .
RESULTS	This was not the case with any patient from the other groups .
RESULTS	Compared to placebo , PONV over the whole @ h observation period was significantly reduced by droperidol ( Fig. @ ; P = @ ) : completely free from PONV : placebo : @ % , @ mg droperidol : @ % , @ mg droperidol : @ % , @ mg droperidol : @ % .
RESULTS	Also the severity of PONV was reduced .
CONCLUSIONS	In gynaecological laparoscopy under general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation , we recommend droperidol @ mg in the prevention of PONV , as it reduces PONV as well as @ mg with no severe sedation in this dosage .
CONCLUSIONS	Psychological side effects did not occur more frequently after droperidol compared to placebo in any of the investigated dosages .

BACKGROUND	High blood pressure ( BP ) in acute stroke patients is both common and associated with a poor outcome , although best management remains unclear .
BACKGROUND	Particular uncertainty exists in patients with carotid stenosis in whom lowering BP might reduce cerebral perfusion and worsen outcome .
METHODS	Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke ( ENOS ) is an international , randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of lowering BP with glyceryl trinitrate in @ patients with acute stroke .
METHODS	This analysis is based on patients with ischaemic stroke for whom information on the carotid status was available .
METHODS	Neurological impairment ( Scandinavian Stroke Scale ) and rate of recurrent stroke were assessed on day @ , and the functional outcome ( modified Rankin score ) was determined on day @ .
METHODS	ENOS is ongoing , therefore analyses are blinded to treatment .
RESULTS	At the time of analysis , @ patients with ischaemic stroke had been randomized into ENOS and data on carotid status were available in @ ( @ % ) of these patients .
RESULTS	Ipsilateral stenosis > or = @ % was present in @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Six of @ ( @ % , @ % confidence interval : @ , @ % ) patients with ipsilateral stenosis < @ % had a recurrent stroke by @ days as compared with none of @ patients ( @ % , @ % confidence interval : @ , @ % ) ( P = @ ) with stenosis > or = @ % .
RESULTS	No significant difference in impairment was present on day @ ; mean Scandinavian Stroke Scale with stenosis @ versus no stenosis @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Adjusted functional outcome after @ days was worse in those with a baseline carotid stenosis > or = @ % ; median modified Rankin score @ versus @ ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Interim data provide reassurance that it is reasonable to continue including patients with carotid stenosis into trials of acute BP lowering ( such as ENOS ) .

BACKGROUND	Similar to cardiac surgery patients , medical-surgical critically ill patients may benefit from intensive insulin therapy .
BACKGROUND	The objectives of this pilot trial were to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized trial of intensive insulin therapy with respect to ( a ) achieving target glucose values in the @ ranges of @ to @ and @ to @ mmol/L and ( b ) uncovering problems with the protocol in anticipation of a larger trial .
METHODS	The trial was conducted in a @-bed medical-surgical university-affiliated intensive care unit ( ICU ) .
METHODS	We included patients older than @ years , expected to be in ICU for more than @ hours , with a glucose value of more than @ mmol/L within @ hours of ICU admission .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria were diabetic ketoacidosis , severe hepatic failure or hepatic resection , pancreatitis , glucose of less than @ mmol/L on admission to hospital , insulin infusion on admission to ICU , planned withdrawal of life support , and inability to obtain informed consent .
METHODS	Patients underwent concealed random allocation to a target glucose range of @ to @ or @ to @ mmol/L using pretested algorithms of insulin infusions .
METHODS	Dedicated glucometer measurement of arterial glucose values was calibrated daily to values measured in the laboratory .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ patients with a mean ( SD ) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation ( APACHE ) II score of @ ( @ ) ; @ were insulin-dependent pre-ICU , and all were medical admissions .
RESULTS	Mean glucose values were different in the @ groups ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ mmol/L , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Although the intensive insulin therapy group had more glucose measurements performed than the control group , a similar proportion of values were within the target range ( @ [ @ % ] of @ values in the @ - to @-mmol/L range ; @ [ @ % ] of @ values in the @ - to @-mmol/L range , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Glucose values of less than @ mmol/L developed @ times in @ patients , @ of whom were in the intensive insulin therapy group ; however , no adverse consequences were documented .
RESULTS	As expected , there were no differences in clinically important outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	In this pilot trial of ICU patients with high illness severity , glucose values were in the @ target ranges only @ % of the time , using well-accepted initiation and maintenance insulin infusion algorithms .
CONCLUSIONS	A large randomized trial of glycemic control is feasible in this population to examine clinically important outcomes , but will require refined insulin algorithms and more comprehensive behavior change strategies to achieve target values .

BACKGROUND	Infants with very low birth weight ( VLBW ) are at increased risk for motor deficits , which may be reduced by early intervention programs .
BACKGROUND	For detection of motor deficits and to monitor intervention , different assessment tools are available .
BACKGROUND	It is important to choose tools that are sensitive to evaluate the efficacy of intervention on motor outcome .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to compare the Alberta Infant Motor Scale ( AIMS ) and the Psychomotor Developmental Index ( PDI ) of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Dutch Second Edition ( BSID-II-NL ) in their ability to evaluate effects of an early intervention , provided by pediatric physical therapists , on motor development in infants with VLBW at @ months corrected age ( CA ) .
METHODS	This was a secondary study in which data collected from a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) were used .
METHODS	At @ months CA , @ of @ infants with VLBW participating in an RCT on the effect of the Infant Behavioral Assessment and Intervention Program were assessed with both the AIMS and the PDI .
METHODS	Intervention effects on the AIMS and PDI were compared .
RESULTS	Corrected for baseline differences , significant intervention effects were found for AIMS and PDI scores .
RESULTS	The highest effect size was for the AIMS subscale sit .
RESULTS	A significant reduction of abnormal motor development in the intervention group was found only with the AIMS .
CONCLUSIONS	No Dutch norms are available for the AIMS .
CONCLUSIONS	The responsiveness of the AIMS to detect intervention effects was better than that of the PDI .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , caution is recommended in monitoring infants with VLBW only with the PDI , and the use of both the AIMS and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development is advised when evaluating intervention effects on motor development at @ months CA .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose ( @ mg ) of tamsulosin , a selective alpha @A-adrenoreceptor antagonist , with an increasing dose ( @-@ mg ) of terazosin , a non-selective antagonist , in the treatment of urinary outflow obstruction associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) in Korean patients .
METHODS	The study comprised a single-blind and randomized design with tamsulosin or terazosin taken once daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	A total of @ patients was enrolled , with @ patients included in the analyses after @ and @ weeks .
METHODS	The primary variables assessed were changes in the maximum urinary flow rate Qmax and the total International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) , with the post-void residual urine volume , ` obstructive ' and ` irritative ' questions in the IPSS , and the investigators ' global assessment of efficacy also determined .
METHODS	The number of patients with a clinically significant response to treatment with tamsulosin or terazosin was determined and defined as those with > @ % improvement from the baseline Qmax or > @ % decrease in total IPSS .
METHODS	Adverse reactions possibly or probably related to study medication were recorded throughout the treatment period .
RESULTS	Both tamsulosin and terazosin produced similar significant improvements in subjective and objective symptoms of urinary outflow obstruction ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Systolic and diastolic ( standing ) blood pressures decreased significantly in patients treated with terazosin ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The adverse reactions , most frequently dry mouth and dizziness which were usually mild and transient , were significantly higher in patients on terazosin ( @ patients , versus one on tamsulosin , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The changes led to discontinuation of therapy in two patients on terazosin .
CONCLUSIONS	Tamsulosin was as effective as terazosin in treating urinary outflow obstruction associated with BPH , but had a markedly better safety profile .

BACKGROUND	Pulse oximetry , used to monitor oxygen saturation during endoscopy , does not directly measure hypoventilation .
BACKGROUND	Study goals were to determine whether transcutaneous carbon dioxide ( PtcCO ( @ ) ) monitoring during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) prevents severe hypoventilation and to assess the accuracy of clinical observation and pulse oximetry in detecting hypoventilation .
METHODS	All patients received intensive clinical and electronic monitoring including pulse oximetry .
METHODS	Supplemental oxygen was administered for pulse oximetry < @ % .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to a treatment arm ( group @ ) where PtcCO ( @ ) monitoring guided sedation or a control arm ( group @ ) where PtcCO ( @ ) was recorded but unavailable for guiding sedation .
RESULTS	Group @ had significantly fewer episodes of severe carbon dioxide retention ( rise in PtcCO ( @ ) > / = @ mm Hg above baseline ) than group @ ( @ of @ versus @ of @ , respectively , p = @ ) , as well a shorter mean duration of procedure discomfort ( @ % of procedure duration rated as `` uncomfortable '' versus @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Correlations between clinical observation and objective measures of ventilation were poor : level of sedation versus PtcCO ( @ ) ( R = @ ) or pulse oximetry ( R = @ ) ; slowest respiratory rate versus PtcCO ( @ ) ( R = @ ) or pulse oximetry ( R = -@ ) .
RESULTS	PtcCO ( @ ) rises of greater than @ mm Hg occurred without oxygen desaturation in @ % of patients receiving supplemental oxygen .
CONCLUSIONS	Carbon dioxide retention during ERCP is not reliably detected by clinical observation or by pulse oximetry in patients receiving supplemental oxygen .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of PtcCO ( @ ) monitoring prevents severe carbon dioxide retention more effectively than intensive clinical monitoring and pulse oximetry alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The clinical relevancy of this observation needs to be determined in an appropriately designed outcome study .

OBJECTIVE	Relationships between intraocular pressure ( IOP ) and baseline characteristics are explored in a subgroup of children participating in the Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial .
OBJECTIVE	The @-year follow-up also provides information on the relationship between IOP , myopic progression , and change in axial length .
METHODS	Right eye IOP , cycloplegic autorefraction , and axial length were measured at baseline and annually in @/@ children at one of the Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial centers .
RESULTS	At baseline , IOP for the cohort was @ + / - @ mm Hg .
RESULTS	IOP decreased ( @ mm Hg/year ) over the follow-up ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	IOP of Blacks ( n = @ ; @ + / - @ mm Hg ) was higher than Hispanics ( n = @ ; @ + / - @ mm Hg , p = @ ) , Whites ( n = @ ; @ + / - @ mm Hg , p = @ ) and all non-Blacks combined ( n = @ ; @ + / - @ mm Hg , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	IOP averaged over the six visits did not differ by gender ( mean difference = @ mm Hg ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant association between baseline IOP and baseline myopia or myopic progression , and no significant relationship between IOP the year prior to myopic progression measured over the following year .
RESULTS	The same results were found for IOP and axial length .
CONCLUSIONS	Small but significant ethnic differences were noted in the IOP of myopic children , with Blacks having higher values .
CONCLUSIONS	IOP was not associated with gender , baseline refractive error , baseline axial length , myopic progression , or change in axial length over the @-year observation period .

OBJECTIVE	To explore public attitudes toward the incorporation of cost-effectiveness analysis into clinical decisions .
METHODS	The authors presented @ jurors with a survey describing @ of @ clinical encounters in which a physician has to choose between cancer screening tests .
METHODS	They provided cost-effectiveness data for all tests , and in each scenario , the most effective test was more expensive .
METHODS	They instructed respondents to imagine that he or she was the physician in the scenario and asked them to choose which test to recommend and then explain their choice in an open-ended manner .
METHODS	The authors then qualitatively analyzed the responses by identifying themes and developed a coding scheme .
METHODS	Two authors separately coded the statements with high overall agreement ( kappa = @ ) .
METHODS	Categories were not mutually exclusive .
RESULTS	Overall , @ respondents ( @ % ) chose the most expensive option , and @ respondents ( @ % ) choose a less expensive option .
RESULTS	Explanatory comments were given by @ % respondents .
RESULTS	Respondents who chose the most expensive test focused on the increased benefit ( without directly acknowledging the additional cost ) ( @ % ) , a general belief that life is more important than money ( @ % ) , the significance of cancer risk for the patient in the scenario ( @ % ) , the belief that the benefit of the test was worth the additional cost ( @ % ) , and personal anecdotes/preferences ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Of the respondents who chose the less expensive test , @ % indicated that they did not believe that the patient in the scenario was at significant risk for cancer , @ % indicated that they thought the less expensive test was adequate or not meaningfully different from the more expensive test , @ % thought the cost of the test was not worth the additional benefit , @ % indicated that the test was too expensive ( without mention of additional benefit ) , and @ % responded that resources were limited .
CONCLUSIONS	Public response to cost-quality tradeoffs is mixed .
CONCLUSIONS	Although some respondents justified their decision based on the cost-effectiveness information provided , many focused instead on specific features of the scenario or on general beliefs about whether cost should be incorporated into clinical decisions .

BACKGROUND	To reduce the duration of sick leave and loss of productivity due to common mental disorders ( CMDs ) , we developed a return-to-work programme to be provided by occupational physicians ( OPs ) based on the principles of exposure in vivo ( RTW-E programme ) .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluates this programme 's effectiveness and cost-effectiveness by comparing it with care as usual ( CAU ) .
BACKGROUND	The three research questions we have are : @ ) Is an RTW-E programme more effective in reducing the sick leave of employees with common mental disorders , compared with care as usual ?
BACKGROUND	@ ) Is an RTW-E programme more effective in reducing sick leave for employees with anxiety disorders compared with employees with other common mental disorders ?
BACKGROUND	@ ) From a societal perspective , is an RTW-E programme cost-effective compared with care as usual ?
METHODS	This study was designed as a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial with a one-year follow-up and randomization on the level of OPs .
METHODS	We aimed for @ OPs in order to include @ patients .
METHODS	Patients in the intervention group received the RTW-E programme .
METHODS	Patients in the control group received care as usual .
METHODS	Eligible patients had been on sick leave due to common mental disorders for at least two weeks and no longer than eight weeks .
METHODS	As primary outcome measures , we calculated the time until full return to work and the duration of sick leave .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures were time until partial return to work , prevalence rate of sick leave at @ , @ , @ , and @ months ' follow-up , and scores of symptoms of distress , anxiety , depression , somatization , and fatigue ; work capacity ; perceived working conditions ; self-efficacy for return to work ; coping behaviour ; avoidance behaviour ; patient satisfaction ; and work adaptations .
METHODS	As process measures , we used indices of compliance with the intervention in the intervention group and employee-supervisor communication in both groups .
METHODS	Economic costs were calculated from a societal perspective .
METHODS	The total costs consisted of the costs of consuming health care , costs of production loss due to sick leave and reduced productivity , and out-of-pocket costs of patients for travelling to their OP .

BACKGROUND	Antifibrinolytic drugs including aprotinin and tranexamic acid are currently used in cardiac surgery to reduce postoperative bleeding and transfusion requirements , and may have different effects on platelets .
BACKGROUND	We therefore evaluated platelet function after cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) and cardiac surgery to determine the effect of either aprotinin or tranexamic acid .
METHODS	In a prospective , randomized study , @ patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB were evaluated .
METHODS	Patients received high-dose aprotinin ( n = @ ) or tranexamic acid ( n = @ ) as antifibrinolytic drugs .
METHODS	Coagulation and platelet function were assessed preoperatively , after CPB , @ and @ h after surgery using modified thrombelastography and whole blood aggregometry .
RESULTS	Impaired coagulation after CPB occurred in both groups compared with preoperative data ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast to modified thrombelastography , thrombin receptor-mediated aggregometry after CPB was significantly decreased only in those patients receiving tranexamic acid until the end of the study period in comparison to the aprotinin group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Aprotinin-treated patients showed significantly less chest tube drainage ( @ mL + / - @ vs @ mL + / - @ , P < @ ) and need for postoperative transfusion requirements ( P < @ ) compared with the tranexamic acid group .
CONCLUSIONS	Platelet function measured by whole blood aggregometry is better preserved by aprotinin than tranexamic acid and may be responsible for producing less bleeding within the first @ h after CPB .

BACKGROUND	Intravenous opioids often are used as a component of anesthesia during neurosurgical procedures .
BACKGROUND	However , the cerebrovascular effects of alfentanil administered to patients are controversial .
BACKGROUND	In this study , the effect of alfentanil in patients with and without intracranial pathology was studied .
METHODS	Sixteen neurosurgical patients and @ patients scheduled for orthopedic procedures were studied .
METHODS	Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane ( @-@ @ vol % inspired ) and nitrous oxide ( @ % ) in oxygen .
METHODS	Within each group , the patients were assigned randomly to receive either @ or @ micrograms/kg intravenous alfentanil .
METHODS	During normocapnia and without surgical stimulation , the right middle cerebral artery flow velocity , and mean arterial pressure were measured every minute for @ min after the administration of alfentanil .
METHODS	In the neurosurgical patients , intracranial pressure , cerebral perfusion pressure , and cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference were determined also .
METHODS	Neurosurgical patients received intravenous phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure as needed .
RESULTS	There was no significant change in middle cerebral artery flow velocity and arteriovenous oxygen content difference in the neurosurgical patients .
RESULTS	In the high-dose group , intracranial pressure increased by @ mmHg at @ min but was otherwise unchanged .
RESULTS	Despite phenylephrine administration , there was an immediate but transient decrease in mean arterial pressure in the high-dose group and a corresponding decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure .
RESULTS	In the orthopedic patients , mean arterial pressure decreased significantly .
RESULTS	Middle cerebral artery flow velocity decreased in the high-dose group but remained unchanged in the low-dose group .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the flow velocity and metabolic data , alfentanil is neither a cerebral vasodilator nor a vasoconstrictor in these doses .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , there was no clinically significant increase in intracranial pressure when alfentanil was administered in either dose .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effectiveness of dental health care services in facilitating recovery from quality of life decrements in symptom-specific subgroups with the most prevalent chronic infectious diseases ( periodontal disease and dental caries ) , and a ` stained teeth ' subgroup .
METHODS	Data were taken from the prospective longitudinal Florida Dental Care Study of @ individuals @ + years old .
METHODS	Logistic regression modeling quantified associations between recovery from oral health-related quality of life decrements ( ` recovery ' ) and dental services .
RESULTS	Adjusting for age , race , gender , income , approach to dental care , and signs/symptoms , any dental visit ( odds ratio , OR : @ ; @ % confidence interval , CI : @ , @ ) , corrective treatment ( OR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) , denture visit ( OR :@ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) , or extraction ( OR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) were positively associated with recovery .
RESULTS	Upon conditioning the analyses on specific symptoms , point estimates increased substantially for most service types , and dental cleaning was associated with recovery for the stained teeth subgroup ( OR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dental care was highly effective in treating quality of life decrements .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment effectiveness increased substantially when analyses were restricted to symptom-specific subgroups similar to selection criteria of randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Restricted cohort analyses can be applied to many other health outcomes for which RCTs are not feasible or ethical .

OBJECTIVE	Various types of fractionation schemes have been tried in recent year with the objective of improving tumor control rate because conventional fractionation schedules do not always produce optimum results .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the radiobiological effectiveness and the gain in the therapeutic ratio due to various fractionation schemes , empirical formulae such as NSD , TDF , CRE and TSD were introduced and used despite of many short comings .
OBJECTIVE	Recent linear quadratic ( LQ ) model is claimed to be able to predict the radiobiological responses of tumor as well as normal tissues more accurately .
OBJECTIVE	In the present study various empirical models are compared .
METHODS	We treated malignancy of cervix uteri by twice daily fractionation schedules of @ Gy/fraction , @ Gy/fraction and @ Gy/fraction with interfraction interval of four to six hours .
METHODS	The percentage tumor regression was estimated from weekly clinical observations and the TDFt , TSD and ERDt concepts were applied to the data and the predictions are compared .
RESULTS	It was observed that TDFt and TSD concepts predicts equally well ( within + / - @ % ) the probable tumor regression as predicted by LQ concept .
CONCLUSIONS	Till precise values of various parameters of LQ model are known , the TDF and TSD models can be used to predict probable tumor control rates within reasonable accuracy .

METHODS	Fourty-two healthy adult volunteers ( @ men and @ women ) with an average age of @ ( SD @ ) years and with serum total cholesterol concentrations below @ mg/dl , consumed during two consecutive periods of @ weeks two different low-fat spreads .
METHODS	Both the plant sterol rich and control spreads contained @ % of fat and had an almost equal fat composition .
METHODS	The sterol content of the enriched spread was @ % .
METHODS	Intake of the spreads was @ g/day .
RESULTS	Serum total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations lowered by @ % ( @ mg/dl ) and @ % ( @ mg/dl ) , respectively , with the plant sterol-enriched compared to the control spread .
RESULTS	Serum HDL-cholesterol concentration did not significantly differ between the two spreads .
RESULTS	Apolipoprotein B concentrations lowered by @ % ( @ g/l ) with the plant sterol-enriched spread , while concentrations of apolipoprotein A-I did not change .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings indicate that a daily intake of @ gram low-fat spread containing @ gram plant sterol per day is effective in lowering blood total and LDL cholesterol , and apolipoprotein B concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	This lowering may help to reduce the risk of heart disease in the population .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to define the pre-operative angiographic variables that could influence graft patency and flow pattern .
BACKGROUND	Saphenous vein grafts ( SVG ) and pedicled right gastroepiploic artery ( RGEA ) grafts are routinely used to revascularize the right coronary artery ( RCA ) .
BACKGROUND	Little is known about the predictive value of objective pre-operative angiographic parameters on the @-month graft patency and on the interest of these parameters to select the optimal graft material in individual cases .
METHODS	We prospectively enrolled @ consecutive patient candidates for coronary revascularization .
METHODS	Revascularization of the RCA was randomly performed with SVG in @ patients or with the RGEA in @ patients .
METHODS	Both groups were comparable with respect to all pre-operative continuous and discrete variable and risk factors .
METHODS	All patients underwent a systematic angiographic control @ months after surgery .
METHODS	Pre-operative angiographic parameters included minimal lumen diameter ( MLD ) , percent stenosis and reference diameter of the RCA measured by quantitative angiography ( CAAS II system , Pie Medical , Maastricht , the Netherlands ) , location of the stenosis , run off of the RCA , and regional wall motion of the revascularized territory .
RESULTS	A significant difference in the distribution of flow patterns was observed between SVG and RGEA .
RESULTS	In multivariate analysis , graft-dependent flow pattern was significantly associated with both MLD and percent stenosis of the RCA in the RGEA group but with percent stenosis only in the SVG group .
RESULTS	In the RGEA group , the proportion of patent grafts was higher when MLD was below a threshold value lying in the third MLD quartile ( @ to @ mm ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Pre-operative angiography predicts graft patency in RGEA , whereas the flow pattern in SVG is significantly less influenced by quantitative angiographic parameters .

BACKGROUND	The conventional view that participants in randomised controlled trials sacrifice themselves for the good of future patients is challenged by increasing evidence to suggest that individual patients benefit from participation in trials .
OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that trial participants receive higher quality care and , as a consequence , have better outcomes than patients receiving guideline driven routine care .
METHODS	Retrospective comparative study of @ women with pre-eclampsia all managed according to a strict protocol .
METHODS	Trial participants were @ women who participated in a multicentre randomised controlled trial of magnesium sulphate for the treatment of pre-eclampsia ( Magpie Trial ) ; @ non-participants formed the control group .
METHODS	Indicators of the process of care and clinical outcomes were compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	Trial participants were significantly more likely to have received daily blood tests ( odds ratio ( OR ) @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) and had their respiration rate measured hourly ( OR @ , @ % CI @ to @ ) than control patients .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in other markers of clinical process and no significant difference in clinical outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows minor differences in process markers and no difference in clinical outcomes between patients in a clinical trial and patients receiving protocol driven care .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefits of improved clinical care that have previously been associated with being in a trial may be explained by the use of clear clinical protocols .
CONCLUSIONS	In routine practice , patients may be well advised to insist on treatment as part of a protocol .

BACKGROUND	Several clinical trials have established the benefit of using a topical corticosteroid in conjunction with tazarotene gel in the treatment of plaque psoriasis .
BACKGROUND	However , there is little information comparing the relative benefits of different corticosteroids , or different formulations of corticosteroids , when used adjunctively with tazarotene .
OBJECTIVE	This study was designed to compare the clinical benefits achieved with each of six commonly prescribed high - or mid-high-potency corticosteroid creams and ointments applied in conjunction with tazarotene @ % gel in the treatment of patients with stable plaque psoriasis .
METHODS	A @-week , multicenter , investigator-masked , randomized , parallel-group study was performed with more than @ patients who were randomly assigned to regimens of tazarotene @ % gel alone , tazarotene plus a high-potency topical corticosteroid ( fluocinonide @ % ointment , mometasone furoate @ % ointment , or diflorasone diacetate @ % ointment ) , or tazarotene plus a mid-high-potency topical corticosteroid ( betamethasone dipropionate @ % cream , fluticasone propionate @ % ointment , or diflorasone diacetate @ % cream ) .
METHODS	All medications were to be applied once daily : corticosteroids in the morning , tazarotene gel in the evening .
METHODS	At assessment visits , physicians made an overall evaluation of the patient 's psoriasis and graded global improvement , plaque elevation , scaling , erythema , and pruritus .
METHODS	Patients also rated their treatment in terms of efficacy , tolerability , and satisfaction .
RESULTS	The best-performing steroid was betamethasone dipropionate @ % cream ( a mid-high-potency steroid ) , followed by mometasone furoate @ % ointment ( a high-potency steroid ) and diflorasone diacetate @ % ointment ( a high-potency steroid ) .
RESULTS	Maximum improvements were achieved within @ weeks .
RESULTS	The best-tolerated regimen was tazarotene plus mometasone furoate @ % ointment and the optimal balance between efficacy and tolerability was achieved with this regimen .
CONCLUSIONS	Some steroids are considerably more effective than others in optimizing the efficacy and tolerability of tazarotene therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	With a suitable combination regimen , the duration of initial therapy ( before maintenance therapy is started ) need not be prolonged .

BACKGROUND	Clustering of outcomes at centers involved in multicenter trials is a type of center effect .
BACKGROUND	The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement recommends that multicenter randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) should account for center effects in their analysis , however most do not .
BACKGROUND	The Early External Cephalic Version ( EECV ) trials published in @ and @ stratified by center at randomization , but did not account for center in the analyses , and due to the nature of the intervention and number of centers , may have been prone to center effects .
BACKGROUND	Using data from the EECV trials , we undertook an empirical study to compare various statistical approaches to account for center effect while estimating the impact of external cephalic version timing ( early or delayed ) on the outcomes of cesarean section , preterm birth , and non-cephalic presentation at the time of birth .
METHODS	The data from the EECV pilot trial and the EECV@ trial were merged into one dataset .
METHODS	Fisher 's exact method was used to test the overall effect of external cephalic version timing unadjusted for center effects .
METHODS	Seven statistical models that accounted for center effects were applied to the data .
METHODS	The models included : i ) the Mantel-Haenszel test , ii ) logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment effect , iii ) center-size weighted and iv ) un-weighted logistic regression with fixed center effect and fixed treatment-by-center interaction , iv ) logistic regression with random center effect and fixed treatment effect , v ) logistic regression with random center effect and random treatment-by-center interaction , and vi ) generalized estimating equations .
RESULTS	For each of the three outcomes of interest approaches to account for center effect did not alter the overall findings of the trial .
RESULTS	The results were similar for the majority of the methods used to adjust for center , illustrating the robustness of the findings .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite literature that suggests center effect can change the estimate of effect in multicenter trials , this empirical study does not show a difference in the outcomes of the EECV trials when accounting for center effect .
BACKGROUND	The EECV@ trial was registered on @ July @ @ with Current Controlled Trials : ISRCTN @ .

BACKGROUND	In patients with ultrasound-visible hydrosalpinges , salpingectomy prior to IVF increases the chance of a live birth .
BACKGROUND	This study compared the cost-effectiveness of this strategy ( intervention ) with that of optional salpingectomy after a failed cycle ( control ) .
METHODS	Data from a Scandinavian randomized controlled trial were used to calculate the individual number of treatments and their outcomes .
METHODS	Only patients with ultrasound-visible hydrosalpinges were considered in the main analysis , and a maximum of three fresh cycles were included .
METHODS	The costs for surgical procedures , IVF treatment , medication , complications , management of pregnancy and delivery as well as of early pregnancy losses were calculated from standardized hospital charges .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients in the intervention group , the live birth rate was @ % compared with @ % in @ controls .
RESULTS	The average cost per patient was @,@ euro and @,@ euro , respectively .
RESULTS	Thus , the average cost per live birth was @,@ euro in the intervention group and @,@ euro in the control group .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adopting the intervention strategy was estimated at @ euro .
CONCLUSIONS	The incremental cost to achieve the higher birth rate of the intervention strategy seems reasonable .

METHODS	Participants completed measures assessing their perception of the quality of the therapeutic relationship , eating disorder ( ED ) symptomatology , and depressive symptomatology .
RESULTS	Beyond the effect of early treatment change and treatment assignment , early therapeutic alliance was a significant predictor of Restraint and Shape Concern at follow-up ( ps < @ ) .
RESULTS	Late therapeutic alliance was a significant predictor of weight change , depressive symptomatology , and ED symptomatology at end of treatment and follow-up ( ps < @ ) , with the exception of Shape Concern at follow-up ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results suggest that therapeutic alliance can be effectively established in the treatment of SE-AN and may be relevant for treatment response , particularly in late treatment , on some aspects of ED and depressive symptomatology .

OBJECTIVE	Radiation therapy for head-and-neck cancer requires a reliable immobilization for an accurate and consistent treatment setup .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective , randomized study was done to compare two types of Posicast thermoplastic face masks , in terms of reproducibility , patient comfort , tolerability , and skin damage .
METHODS	The patients were randomly assigned to use a head mask ( HM ) or a head-and-shoulder mask ( HSM ) .
METHODS	Three-dimensional treatment planning was followed by fractionated external-beam radiation therapy .
METHODS	Reproducibility was assessed by comparing port films with simulator films twice during treatment and by comparing actual treatment table positions weekly .
METHODS	Patient tolerability and comfort were studied weekly .
METHODS	The radiation-induced skin damage was assessed every week according to the World Health Organization toxicity scale .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were included , and @ ( @ % ) were evaluated .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences between the groups ( HM or HSM ) in terms of reproducibility .
RESULTS	Patients using HSM experienced significantly more claustrophobia ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients allocated to HSM receiving > or = @ Gy were found to have more skin reactions .
CONCLUSIONS	The smaller HM reduced feelings of claustrophobia , as well as skin reactions , for patients receiving > or = @ Gy .
CONCLUSIONS	The smaller mask did not compromise the reproducibility of the setup .

BACKGROUND	The objective of the study was to analyze optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) scan differences between patients with predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) secondary to age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) treated with only photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) and patients treated with PDT combined with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide ( IVTA ) .
METHODS	In this prospective study , @ patients were randomized to receive PDT ( n = @ ) or PDT combined with IVTA ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	They were evaluated every @ months with a refraction protocol for best-corrected visual acuity ( VA ) measured with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) charts , fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , and OCT. .
METHODS	When measuring foveal thickness on OCT scans , neuroretinal foveal thickness ( NFT ) was differentiated from outer high reflectivity band thickness ( OHRBT ) .
METHODS	The main outcome measures were mean change in OCT measurements and correlation of VA and angiographic area of the lesion with OCT measurements .
RESULTS	At the @-month follow-up , the mean change in NFT was not significantly reduced ( P = @ ) , but the mean change in OHRBT was significantly lower ( P = @ ) in the group of patients who received combined therapy .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between final VA and NFT in either patient group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The final VA was significantly worse in eyes with a thicker OHRBT ( P = @ ) in the group of patients treated with only PDT .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between angiographic area and NFT and OHRBT in either patient group ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a statistically significant difference between the pre-treatment angiographic area of the lesion and VA at the @-month follow-up in the combined therapy group ( P = @ ) , and more eyes treated with only PDT presented with intraretinal fluid at the last follow-up ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Combined PDT+IVTA therapy was more effective than PDT alone at reducing OHRBT .
CONCLUSIONS	This OCT measurement seems to be have a greater effect on VA than NFT .

OBJECTIVE	The clinical benefit of sacral neuromodulation is unclear due to the paucity of randomized trial data .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate sacral neuromodulation for management of urinary and fecal incontinence in a pediatric population .
METHODS	This multicenter , open label , randomized , crossover study included children older than @ years .
METHODS	After trial stimulation of the S@ root a neuromodulator ( InterStim ) was implanted on the S@ foramen .
METHODS	Clinical examinations , voiding and bowel diaries , and urodynamic and manometric evaluations were performed at the beginning ( t@ ) and end ( t@ ) of the first period , and at the beginning ( t@ ) and end ( t@ ) of the second period .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ boys ) with a mean + / - SD age of @ + / - @ years were randomized .
RESULTS	Etiologies were mainly of neurological origin .
RESULTS	Incontinence was mixed urinary and fecal in @ cases , urinary only in @ and fecal only in @ .
RESULTS	Cystometric bladder capacity increased during sacral neuromodulation ( delta +@ ml vs -@ ml , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant change in other urodynamic or manometric parameters .
RESULTS	Overall positive response rate was more than @ % for urinary ( @ % ) and bowel ( @ % ) function .
RESULTS	Crossover analysis indicated that sacral neuromodulation is more effective than conservative treatment for both types of incontinence ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In a pediatric population sacral neuromodulation is effective for bladder and bowel dysfunction and should be considered before irreversible surgery .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the immunogenicity of a fully liquid diphtheria-tetanus-five component acellular pertussis-inactivated poliomyelitis-Haemophilus influenzae type b ( DTaP-IPV-Hib ) conjugate vaccine compared to DTaP-IPV and lyophilized Hib conjugate vaccines given simultaneously at separate sites as a three-dose primary vaccination in Taiwanese infants .
METHODS	Two hundred infants were randomized to receive either DTaP-IPV-Hib or DTaP-IPV plus Hib vaccine at @ , @ , and @ months of age .
METHODS	Both combined vaccines contained the same five pertussis antigens : pertussis toxoid ( PT ) , filamentous hemagglutinin ( FHA ) , pertactin ( PRN ) , fimbriae @ and @ ( FIM @ & @ ) .
METHODS	Antibody concentrations were measured before the first and after the third dose .
METHODS	Reactogenicity was evaluated from parental reports .
METHODS	All subjects received hepatitis B vaccine at @ , @ , and @ months of age following the national vaccination schedule of Taiwan .
RESULTS	The immunogenicity after the third dose was high for each vaccine antigen in both groups , and the vaccines had low reactogenicity .
RESULTS	Statistical analysis showed no differences in the immune responses to the fully liquid DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine compared with those to the DTaP-IPV plus Hib control vaccines , notably the anti-PRP ( polyribose ribitol phosphate capsular polysaccharide ) response , with @-@ % of infants having concentrations > or = @ microg/mL .
RESULTS	Approximately @ % of all infants developed seroprotective levels of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBs ) antibodies ( > or = @ mIU/mL ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both combination vaccines had similar high immunogenicity for each antigen , and both were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , inclusion of a Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in the combination did not result in clinically significant decrease in the PRP response or increase reactogenicity .
CONCLUSIONS	The fully liquid pentavalent vaccine has the advantages of not requiring reconstitution and of administration as a single injection .

OBJECTIVE	Moxifloxacin is a new @-methoxyfluoroquinolone with a broad antibacterial spectrum .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of age and gender on pharmacokinetics , surrogate pharmacodynamics , safety and tolerability of a single dose of moxifloxacin .
METHODS	This was a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group single dose trial in young and elderly healthy volunteers .
METHODS	The study included @ volunteers in @ age and gender groups : young males ( mean age @ years ) , elderly males ( mean age @ years ) , and elderly females ( mean age @ years ) .
METHODS	Participants received either a single @mg oral dose of moxifloxacin ( @/group ) or placebo ( @/group ) .
METHODS	Blood samples for moxifloxacin pharmacokinetics were obtained before and up to @ hours after administration .
METHODS	Urine samples were collected for pharmacokinetics , and volunteers were monitored for clinical adverse events and laboratory abnormalities .
RESULTS	Maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve ( AUC ) were higher in elderly females than in elderly males ; however , when normalised for bodyweight , these pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly different between the groups .
RESULTS	Moreover , the plasma pharmacokinetics in elderly males were not meaningfully different from those in young males .
RESULTS	Elimination half-life averaged @ to @ hours for the @ groups .
RESULTS	Surrogate pharmacodynamic measures were derived using AUC/MIC ( minimal inhibitory concentration ) and Cmax/MIC ratios .
RESULTS	These assessments indicated that , given the linear pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin previously demonstrated , a dose of @mg would produce mean Cmax/MIC values in the different subgroups ranging from @ to @ for an MIC of @ , and @ to @ for an MIC of @ .
RESULTS	The corresponding ranges of projected AUC/MIC ratios would be @ to @ for an MIC of @ , and @ to @ for an MIC of @ .
RESULTS	The accepted target values of AUC/MIC and Cmax/MIC for quinolones are @ and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	There were no serious adverse events or differences in adverse event profiles between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Moxifloxacin does not exhibit age - or gender-dependent pharmacokinetics .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral doses of @ to @mg yield effective antibacterial concentrations on the first day of administration .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the correlation between subjective ( clinical ) treatment outcome and objective uroflowmetry parameters and curve pattern in children with dysfunctional voiding .
METHODS	Seventy-five children were randomly allocated to two urotherapy programs .
METHODS	Group A was submitted to standard urotherapy and pelvic floor exercises while group B received conservative treatment .
METHODS	Constipation and recurrent urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) were treated in both groups .
METHODS	Selected children from both groups received pharmacotherapy ( anticholinergics or desmopressin ) .
METHODS	Uroflowmetry with electromyography of the pelvic floor and ultrasound post-void residual ( PVR ) urine volumes were obtained before and at the end of the @-month treatment period .
METHODS	Uroflowmetry findings were stratified into two categories based on clinical treatment outcome : ` cured ' and ` unchanged ' .
METHODS	Uroflowmetry findings were compared between categories at the beginning and the end of the investigation .
RESULTS	Voided volume , average and peak flow rates were significantly increased while PVR urine was decreased in children with cured urinary incontinence and nocturnal enuresis compared with ` unchanged ' category .
RESULTS	Significant decrease of PVR urine was noted in children with cured UTIs .
RESULTS	The frequency of a bell-shaped curve was significantly higher compared to other curve patterns in children with cured urinary incontinence and UTIs .
CONCLUSIONS	Post-treatment improvement in clinical symptoms correlated with improvement in uroflowmetry parameters and curve pattern .
CONCLUSIONS	Correction of voiding phase is necessary for urinary continence achievement and resolution of UTIs .

OBJECTIVE	The authors sought to determine if an acute dose of dextroamphetamine might have positive effects on affect and cognition in schizophrenic patients maintained on a regimen of haloperidol and , if so , what variables might predict such improvements .
METHODS	Twenty-one patients with chronic schizophrenia who were hospitalized on a research ward received a single oral dose of dextroamphetamine ( @ mg/kg ) in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study .
METHODS	All patients were receiving @ mg/kg per day of haloperidol .
METHODS	Cognitive tests , motor tests , global ratings , mood ratings , and videotape ratings were used to determine the effect of the coadministration of these drugs .
METHODS	Ventricle-brain ratios derived from CT scans were used to predict response to the coadministration of these drugs .
RESULTS	Amphetamine improved performance on a measure of concept formation on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test but did not result in changes in performance on tests of memory or attention .
RESULTS	As a group , the patients were more active and performed psychomotor tests more quickly while receiving amphetamine .
RESULTS	Six patients were judged by clinical raters to have improved in terms of affect , cooperation , and engagement with the environment .
RESULTS	Improvement was associated with enlarged cerebral ventricles and increases in blink rate from the placebo to the active drug condition .
RESULTS	No patient unequivocally worsened .
CONCLUSIONS	These results may be consistent with the theory that coadministration of amphetamine and haloperidol produces relatively selective enhancement of cortical dopaminergic activity .
CONCLUSIONS	However , because of the acute nature of the trial and the specialized research environment in which it was conducted , the authors do not advocate amphetamine as a routine clinical treatment of schizophrenia .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a bovine porous bone mineral used in combination with a porcine derived collagen membrane as a barrier in promoting periodontal regeneration in intrabony defects in humans .
METHODS	The study employed a split-mouth design .
METHODS	@ paired intrabony defects were treated and surgically re-entered @ months after treatment .
METHODS	Experimental sites were grafted with bovine porous bone mineral and received a collagen membrane for guided tissue regeneration .
METHODS	Control sites were treated with an open flap debridement .
RESULTS	Preoperative pocket depths , attachment levels and trans-operative bone measurements were similar for control and experimental sites .
RESULTS	Post surgical measurements revealed a significantly greater reduction in pocket depth ( differences of @ + / - @ mm on buccal @ + / - @ mm on lingual measurements ) and more gain in clinical attachment ( differences of @ + / - @ mm on buccal and @ + / - @ mm on lingual measurements ) in experimental sites .
RESULTS	Surgical reentry of the treated defects revealed a significantly greater amount of defect fill in favor of experimental sites ( differences of @ + / - @ mm on buccal and @ + / - @ mm on lingual measurements ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study indicate that clinical resolution of intrabony defects can be achieved using a combination of bovine porous bone mineral and an absorbable , porcine derived collagen membrane when employing a technique based on the principles of guided tissue regeneration .
CONCLUSIONS	The nature of the attachment between the newly regenerated tissue and the root surfaces needs to be evaluated histologically to confirm the presence of new attachment .

BACKGROUND	Standard treatment for onychomycosis often results in less than half of subjects achieving disease-free nails .
BACKGROUND	Onychomycosis is even more challenging to treat as relapses and re-infections are common .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if a prophylactic effect exists when a treatment with amorolfine nail lacquer ( ANL ) , with half the frequency of the standard regimen , is instituted following successful treatment of dermatophytic toenail onychomycosis with matrix involvement .
METHODS	Efficacy and safety of a group treated with ANL ( once every @ weeks ) were compared with that of an untreated group in a @-month ( @ years ) , single-centre , randomized , open-label , comparison study .
METHODS	Subjects to be included in the study were required to be cured of confirmed onychomycosis with matrix involvement after an initial treatment with either ANL + oral terbinafine or oral terbinafine alone in a previous study .
METHODS	Prophylaxis of onychomycosis was assessed by global recurrence rate , confirmed onychomycosis , clinical recurrence and mycological recurrence .
RESULTS	A total of @ subjects were enrolled ( @ in each group ) in the study .
RESULTS	Throughout the study , recurrences occurred more quickly in the untreated group compared with that in the ANL group .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences were observed at month @ ( ANL , @ % ; untreated , @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At endpoint , @ % of the subjects treated with ANL remained cured compared to @ % in the untreated group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Recurrence was delayed by nearly @ days for the ANL group compared with that of the untreated group .
RESULTS	Amorolfine was safe and well tolerated during the study , with no treatment-related adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that amorolfine nail lacquer may be effective and is safe for use as a prophylactic treatment for the recurrence of onychomycosis .

BACKGROUND	The effect on quality of life ( QOL ) of valsartan administered in addition to prescribed background heart failure therapy was assessed as a secondary endpoint in the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial ( Val-HeFT ) .
RESULTS	QOL was assessed in @ patients receiving either valsartan ( @ mg twice daily ) or placebo in addition to prescribed background therapy ( beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors ) , using the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure ( MLWHF ) questionnaire .
RESULTS	Treatment differences were compared at intervals to @ months after randomization and at endpoint ( last observation ) using analysis of covariance and repeated measures mixed-effects , and at endpoint using a Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test .
RESULTS	Scores lower than baseline were indicative of improved QOL .
RESULTS	Valsartan had a significant beneficial effect on the least-square mean change in overall MLWHF score from baseline to study endpoint ( + / - standard error ) ( average followup @ months ) compared with placebo ( @ + / - @ versus @ + / - @ ; P = @ respectively ) .
RESULTS	The placebo group was characterized by a deterioration in QOL as the trial progressed .
RESULTS	More patients on valsartan reported a clinically meaningful improvement in MLWHF score ( a decrease of > or = @ points ) than on placebo ( @ % versus @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Valsartan compared to placebo added to prescribed therapy slows progressive worsening of QOL in patients with heart failure .

BACKGROUND	Sevoflurane and nitrous oxide have intrinsic cerebral vasodilatory activity .
BACKGROUND	To determine the effects of nitrous oxide on cerebrovascular reactivity to carbon dioxide ( CCO ( @ ) R ) during sevoflurane anaesthesia in children , middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity ( V ( mca ) ) was measured over a range of end-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations ( E ' ( CO ( @ ) ) ) , using transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) ultrasonography .
METHODS	Ten children aged @-@ yr were anaesthetized with sevoflurane and received a caudal block .
METHODS	Patients were allocated randomly to receive either air-nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide-air .
METHODS	Further randomization determined the sequence of E ' ( CO ( @ ) ) ( @ , @ , @ , and @ mm Hg ) and sevoflurane ( @ then @ MAC or @ then @ MAC ) concentrations .
METHODS	Once steady state had been reached , three measurements of V ( mca ) , mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) , and heart rate ( HR ) were recorded .
RESULTS	Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity was reduced in the @-@ mm Hg E ' ( CO ( @ ) ) range on the addition of nitrous oxide to @ MAC , but not @ MAC sevoflurane .
RESULTS	A plateau in CCO ( @ ) R of @-@ @ % per mm Hg was seen in all groups between E ' ( CO ( @ ) ) values of @ and @ mm Hg .
RESULTS	Mean HR and MAP remained constant throughout the study period .
CONCLUSIONS	Cerebrovascular carbon dioxide reactivity is reduced at and above an E ' ( CO ( @ ) ) of @ mm Hg during @ and @ MAC sevoflurane anaesthesia .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of nitrous oxide to @ MAC sevoflurane diminishes CCO ( @ ) R in the hypocapnic range .
CONCLUSIONS	This should be taken into consideration when hyperventilation techniques for reduction of brain bulk are being contemplated in children with raised intracranial pressure .

BACKGROUND	When given as an intravenous bolus for induction of anesthesia , propofol can decrease postintubation hypertension but can also create moderate to severe postinduction , preintubation hypotension .
BACKGROUND	The addition of fentanyl usually decreases the postintubation hypertension but can increase the propofol-induced preintubation hypotension .
BACKGROUND	The goal of the study was to determine the relation between propofol and fentanyl doses and the hemodynamic changes post-induction , preintubation and postintubation .
METHODS	Twelve groups of @ patients , ASA physical status @ or @ , first received fentanyl @ , @ , or @ micrograms.kg-@ and then @ min later received propofol @ , @ , @ , or @ mg.kg-@ as an intravenous bolus for induction of anesthesia .
METHODS	Arterial blood pressure was continuously monitored .
METHODS	The trachea was intubated @ min after propofol administration .
RESULTS	The mean decrease in systolic blood pressure after propofol was @ mmHg when no fentanyl was given , @ mmHg after @ microgram.kg-@ of fentanyl ( P < @ vs. no fentanyl ) , and @ mmHg after @ micrograms.kg-@ ( P < @ vs. no fentanyl ; no statistically significant difference @ vs. @ micrograms.kg-@ ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in hemodynamic response to intubation relative to propofol dose .
RESULTS	Hemodynamic response to intubation was decreased by the administration of fentanyl ; the mean increase of systolic blood pressure after intubation was @ mmHg from preintubation value without fentanyl , @ mmHg after @ micrograms.kg-@ , and @ mmHg after @ micrograms.kg-@ ( P < @ for @ and @ micrograms.kg-@ vs. no fentanyl and for @ vs. @ micrograms.kg-@ ) .
RESULTS	Hemodynamic changes postintubation were not statistically different with increasing doses of propofol .
CONCLUSIONS	Hemodynamic changes after induction with propofol or propofol/fentanyl , pre - or postintubation , are not modified when the propofol dose is increased from @ to @ mg.kg-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Maximal hypotension preintubation occurs with a fentanyl dose of @ micrograms.kg-@ , whereas the magnitude of postintubation hypertension is significantly decreased with an increase in the fentanyl dose to @ micrograms.kg-@ .

OBJECTIVE	Our Level I Pediatric Trauma Center employs pediatric nurse practitioners ( PNP ) to manage inpatients .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that the involvement of a PNP would lead to increased nursing staff satisfaction with patient care .
METHODS	Children admitted to the trauma service were randomized to PNP or resident care groups .
METHODS	Nurses caring for these children were asked to fill out a satisfaction survey regarding the care that the child received .
RESULTS	Sixty-five nurses participated .
RESULTS	Nurses scored the PNP group significantly higher in human qualities , information given about the tests , management of the child 's pain , and response time to pages/questions .
CONCLUSIONS	Involvement of the PNP leads to higher nursing satisfaction scores compared with residents while providing equivalent care for injured children .

OBJECTIVE	To assess prospectively the effects of low dose oestradiol on arterial endothelial and smooth muscle function in healthy men .
OBJECTIVE	Oestrogen use is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease in oestrogen-deficient women , however , the vascular effects of low-dose oestradiol in healthy men have not been investigated previously .
METHODS	Twenty-three men ( aged @ + / - @ years ) were randomized to receive depot implants of testosterone ( T ) alone ( group @ , n = @ ) , or T with either @ mg ( group @ , n = @ ) or @ mg ( group @ , n = @ ) of oestradiol ( E ) .
METHODS	Hormone levels , lipids and vascular reactivity were measured before , @ month and @ months after hormone implantation .
METHODS	Using high-resolution ultrasound , brachial artery diameter was measured at rest , during reactive hyperaemia ( leading to flow-mediated dilatation , FMD , which is endothelium-dependent ) and after sublingual nitroglycerin ( GTN , an endothelium-independent dilator ) .
RESULTS	Oestradiol produced a dose-dependent increase in plasma oestradiol ( at @ month @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ pmol/l in the @ groups , respectively , P < @ by ANOVA for trend ) .
RESULTS	Minor side-effects ( gynaecomastia , nipple tenderness ) indicated that @ mg oestradiol was the maximum tolerated dose .
RESULTS	There was also a dose-dependent increase in FMD with oestradiol dose : at @ month , - @ , + @ and + @ % for groups @-@ , respectively ( P = @ by ANOVA for trend ) ; and at @ months , - @ , + @ and + @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The rise in oestradiol levels following treatment correlated with the improvement in FMD ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	GTN responses were similar in the @ groups throughout the study .
CONCLUSIONS	In healthy young men , oestradiol supplementation is associated with enhanced arterial endothelial function , a key marker of vascular health .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) and a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor , desipramine , effectively reduces obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients who do not respond to SSRIs .
METHODS	In a double-blind study , desipramine or placebo was added for @ or @ weeks to the treatment of @ patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder whose symptoms were refractory to SSRI treatment ( fluvoxamine , fluoxetine , or sertraline ) alone .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between the adjunctive desipramine and placebo groups in obsessive-compulsive or depressive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	These data suggest that clomipramine 's possibly superior efficacy in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive symptoms may not stem from its capacity to inhibit reuptake of norepinephrine .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the changes induced by oral versus transdermal estrogen therapy on the total and free serum concentrations of testosterone ( T ) , thyroxine ( T@ ) , and cortisol ( C ) and the concentrations of their serum binding globulins sex hormone-binding globulin , thyroxine-binding globulin , and cortisol-binding globulin in naturally menopausal women .
METHODS	Randomized , open-label , crossover .
METHODS	Interventions included a @-week withdrawal from previous hormone therapy ( baseline ) , followed in randomized order by @ weeks of oral conjugated equine estrogens ( CEE ) ( @ mg/d ) and @ weeks of transdermal estradiol ( TD E@ ) ( @ mg/d ) , with oral micronized progesterone ( @ mg/d ) given continuously during both transdermal estrogen therapy regimens .
RESULTS	Twenty-seven women were enrolled in the study , and @ completed both treatment periods .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) percentage changes from baseline of sex hormone-binding globulin , total T , and free T with oral CEE were +@ % ( @ % ) , +@ % ( @ % ) , and -@ % ( @ % ) , respectively , versus +@ % ( @ % ) , +@ % ( @ % ) , and +@ % ( @ % ) with TD E@ .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) percentage changes of thyroxine-binding globulin , total T@ , and free T@ with oral CEE were +@ % ( @ % ) , +@ % ( @ % ) , and -@ % ( @ % ) , respectively , versus +@ % ( @ % ) , -@ % ( @ % ) , and +@ % ( @ % ) with TD E@ .
RESULTS	The mean ( SD ) percentage changes of cortisol-binding globulin , total C , and free C with oral CEE were +@ % ( @ % ) , +@ % ( @ % ) , and +@ % ( @ % ) , respectively , versus -@ % ( @ % ) , -@ % ( @ % ) , and +@ % ( @ % ) with TD E@ .
RESULTS	Concentrations of all hormones and binding globulins were significantly different ( P < or = @ ) during administration of oral versus transdermal estrogen therapy , except for free T@ and free C.
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with oral CEE , TD E@ exerts minimal effects on the total and free concentrations of T , T@ , and C and their binding proteins .

BACKGROUND	Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) is a progressive condition with a poor prognosis .
BACKGROUND	Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) signaling plays an important role in its pathobiology .
OBJECTIVE	To assess safety , tolerability , and efficacy of the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib in patients with PAH .
METHODS	Patients with PAH in functional classes II-IV were enrolled in a @-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study .
METHODS	Patients received imatinib ( an inhibitor of PDGFR activity ) @ mg orally once daily ( or placebo ) , which was increased to @ mg if the initial dose was well tolerated .
METHODS	The primary endpoints were safety and change from baseline in the @-minute-walk distance ( @MWD ) .
METHODS	Secondary endpoints included hemodynamics and functional classification .
RESULTS	Fifty-nine patients enrolled ( imatinib [ n = @ ] ; placebo [ n = @ ] ) ; @ completed the study .
RESULTS	Dropouts were equally matched between the two groups .
RESULTS	In the intention-to-treat ( ITT ) population there was no significant change in the @MWD ( mean SD ) in the imatinib versus placebo group ( +@ @ versus -@ @ m ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance ( imatinib -@ @ versus placebo -@ @ dynes s cm , P < @ ) and increase in cardiac output ( imatinib +@ @ versus placebo -@ @ L/min , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events occurred in @ imatinib recipients ( @ % ) and @ placebo recipients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Three deaths occurred in each group .
RESULTS	Post hoc subgroup analyses suggest that patients with greater hemodynamic impairment may respond better than patients with less impairment .
CONCLUSIONS	These data from a Phase II study are consistent with imatinib being well tolerated in patients with PAH , and provide proof of concept for further studies evaluating its safety , tolerability , and efficacy in PAH .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT@ ) .

BACKGROUND	Many patients with head and neck cancer have difficulty swallowing tablet formulations of medications , and use of dispersion preparations may be advantageous .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to determine the relative bioavailability and safety profile of a single dose of gefitinib , an orally active inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase , when administered as a whole @-mg tablet or as a dispersion preparation via drink or nasogastric tube in healthy male volunteers .
METHODS	This was a Phase @ , randomized , open-label , @-period crossover study .
METHODS	Plasma samples obtained before dosing to @ hours after dosing were analyzed for gefitinib using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass-spectrometric detection .
METHODS	The pharmacokinetic parameters of interest included AUC , C ( max ) , and the relative bioavailability of the dispersion via drink or nasogastric tube compared with the standard tablet .
RESULTS	Eighteen healthy white male volunteers were enrolled .
RESULTS	They had a mean age of @ years ( range , @-@ years ) , mean body weight of @ kg ( range , @-@ kg ) , and mean height of @ cm ( range , @-@ cm ) .
RESULTS	The geometric mean AUC was @ ng.h / mL for a single @-mg dose of gefitinib administered as a whole tablet , @ ng.h / mL for the dispersion preparation administered by drink , and @ ng.h / mL for the dispersion preparation administered by nasogastric tube .
RESULTS	The corresponding values for the geometric mean C ( max ) were @ , @ , and @ ng/mL .
RESULTS	The gefitinib dispersion preparation administered by drink had a mean bioavailability of @ % relative to the whole tablet ; the dispersion preparation administered by nasogastric tube had a mean bioavailability of @ % relative to the whole tablet .
RESULTS	For the drink-tablet and nasogastric tube-tablet comparisons , the estimate-of-treatment ratios for the AUC were a respective @ and @ ; for the C ( max ) , they were @ and @ .
RESULTS	There appeared to be no clinically significant differences in absorption or elimination between the preparations .
RESULTS	Three volunteers experienced adverse events ( AEs ) that were considered possibly related to gefitinib ( pruritus and dry skin ) , and @ volunteers experienced procedure-related AEs ( cannula-site reaction and rhinorrhea ) ; these AEs were mild or moderate .
RESULTS	No serious AEs were recorded , and no AEs led to withdrawal of any volunteer .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of a @-mg dose of gefitinib as a dispersion preparation by drink or nasogastric tube achieved a systemic exposure to gefitinib that was consistent with that achieved when gefitinib was administered as a whole tablet .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence of tolerability problems associated with the routes of administration studied in these healthy volunteers .

BACKGROUND	There is need for an evidence-based comparison of clinical management strategies to provide the rationale for selection of a particular therapeutic approach to treatment .
BACKGROUND	Ideal dyspepsia treatment should quickly and conveniently alleviate patient symptoms whilst also minimizing the use of healthcare resources .
OBJECTIVE	To examine dyspepsia symptom relief over @ weeks and compare an omeprazole clinical management strategy with a commonly used combination of antacid-alginate followed by H@-antagonist .
METHODS	Seven hundred and twenty-five patients participated in this randomized , open , parallel group comparison over @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive either an omeprazole treatment strategy ( @ ) consisting of omeprazole @ mg stepping up to @ mg and @ mg as required , or an antacid-alginate/ranitidine treatment strategy ( @ ) consisting of antacid-alginate @ mL q.d.s. stepping up to ranitidine @ mg b.d. and @ mg q.d.s. as required .
RESULTS	A greater proportion of patients receiving the omeprazole clinical management strategy had achieved the stringent health target of complete symptom relief ( @ vs. @ % , P < @ ) at @ weeks .
RESULTS	Forty-six per cent of omeprazole-treated patients were symptom free after the first @ mg step compared to only @ % in the antacid-alginate treated group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Total relief of heartburn , the most common symptom at entry , was achieved by more patients in the omeprazole treatment group than the antacid-alginate/ranitidine treatment group , @ vs. @ % , respectively , at @ weeks , and @ vs. @ % at @ weeks ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with the omeprazole clinical management strategy was superior to the antacid-alginate/ranitidine management strategy in providing relief of acid-related dyspepsia symptoms after @ weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the omeprazole treatment strategy involved fewer GP consultations and thus minimized the use of other healthcare resources .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the relationship between carbohydrate intake and the effect of acarbose on HbA@c in subjects with type @ diabetes treated with acarbose alone , acarbose plus sulfonylurea , acarbose plus metformin , or acarbose plus insulin .
METHODS	We conducted a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study in which subjects with diabetes in four treatment strata ( @ on diet alone , @ treated with metformin , @ treated with sulfonylurea , and @ treated with insulin ) were randomized to treatment with placebo or acarbose for @ months .
METHODS	Before randomization , and @ , @ , @ , and @ months after randomization , fasting blood was obtained for HbA@c , and @-day diet records were collected .
METHODS	Subjects who completed at least @ months of acarbose therapy and provided at least three @-day diet records were included .
RESULTS	In the @ subjects included in this analysis , carbohydrate intake varied from approximately @-@ % of energy There was no significant relationship between carbohydrate intake and change in HbA@c in any of the four treatment strata ( diet : n = @ , r = @ , P = @ ; metformin : n = @ , r = @ , P = @ ; sulfonylurea : n = @ , r = @ , P = @ ; insulin : n = @ , r = -@ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the @ subjects consuming < @ % of energy from carbohydrate , the fall in HbA@c ( @ + / -@ % at baseline to @ + / -@ % on acarbose , P < @ ) was no different from that of the @ subjects consuming > @ % of energy from carbohydrate ( @ + / -@ % at baseline to @ + / -@ % on acarbose , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in carbohydrate intake between those who dropped out of the study because of gastrointestinal side effects and those who did not , and there was no relationship between severity of symptoms and the composition of the diet .
CONCLUSIONS	In subjects with type @ diabetes consuming @-@ % of energy from carbohydrate , the effect of acarbose on HbA@c and gastrointestinal symptoms was not related to carbohydrate intake .

BACKGROUND	Varenicline is approved as an aid to smoking cessation in adults aged > or = @ years .
OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to characterize the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics , safety , and tolerability of varenicline in adolescent smokers .
METHODS	This multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study enrolled healthy @ - to @-year-old smokers ( > or = @ cigarettes daily ) into high-body-weight ( > @ kg ) and low-body-weight ( < or = @ kg ) groups .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to receive @ days of treatment with a high dose of varenicline , a low dose of varenicline , or placebo .
METHODS	The varenicline doses in the high-body-weight group were @ mg BID and @ mg BID ; the varenicline doses in the low-body-weight group were @ mg BID and @ mg once daily .
METHODS	The apparent renal clearance ( CL/F ) and volume of distribution ( V/F ) of varenicline and the effect of body weight on these parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling .
RESULTS	The high-body-weight group consisted of @ subjects ( @ % male ; @ % white ; mean age , @ years ) .
RESULTS	The low-body-weight group consisted of @ subjects ( @ % male ; @ % white ; mean age , @ years ) .
RESULTS	The pharmacokinetic parameters of varenicline were dose proportional over the dose range from @ to @ mg/d .
RESULTS	The CL/F for a @-kg adolescent was @ L/h , comparable to that in a @-kg adult .
RESULTS	The estimated varenicline V/F was decreased in individuals of small body size , thus predicting a varenicline C ( max ) approximately @ % greater in low-body-weight subjects than in high-body-weight subjects .
RESULTS	In high-body-weight subjects , steady-state varenicline exposure , as represented by the AUC ( @-@ ) , was @ ng .
RESULTS	h/mL for varenicline @ mg BID and @ ng .
RESULTS	h/mL for varenicline @ mg BID , consistent with values reported previously in adult smokers at the equivalent doses .
RESULTS	In low-body-weight subjects , varenicline exposure was @ ng .
RESULTS	h/mL for varenicline @ mg BID and @ ng .
RESULTS	h/mL for varenicline @ mg once daily , values at the lower end of the range observed previously in adults at doses of @ mg BID and @ mg BID , respectively .
RESULTS	Among high-body-weight subjects , adverse events ( AEs ) were reported by @ % of subjects in both the high - and low-dose varenicline groups and by @ % of subjects in the placebo group ; among low-body-weight subjects , AEs were reported by @ % , @ % , and @ % of subjects in the high-dose varenicline , low-dose varenicline , and placebo groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The most common AEs were nausea , headache , vomiting , and dizziness .
RESULTS	Psychiatric AEs that were considered treatment related included abnormal dreams in @ subjects and mild , transient anger in @ subject .
RESULTS	Of the AEs reported by > or = @ subject in any treatment group , > or = @ % were mild in intensity .
RESULTS	No subject discontinued the study because of an AE .
CONCLUSIONS	Varenicline steady-state exposure in study subjects weighing > @ kg was similar to that observed previously in adults .
CONCLUSIONS	The body-weight effect on varenicline pharmacokinetics , which resulted in higher exposure in individuals of smaller body size ( < or = @ kg ) , was adequately offset by administration of half the varenicline dose recommended in adults .
CONCLUSIONS	Varenicline was generally well tolerated during the @-day treatment period .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Trials Identification Number : NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Spatial orientation in natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) has been identified as a potential barrier to clinical application .
BACKGROUND	We aim to evaluate a triaxial inertial sensor and software that automatically corrects any movements on the roll axis of the flexible endoscope , allowing for stabilization of the image horizon during NOTES operations in a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	A total of @ participants ( @ surgeons/@ gastroenterologists ) performed a transgastric task in the ELITE simulator , which included navigation to the appendix and gallbladder , diathermy of the appendix base and gallbladder fossa , and clipping of the cystic duct using a single-channel gastroscope .
METHODS	Each participant performed the task twice with randomization to horizon stabilization occurring at the second attempt .
METHODS	The primary end point was change in overall performance ( time taken and errors made ) between the first and second attempt , and secondary end points were absolute performances in the second attempt and subjective evaluation .
RESULTS	Without horizon stabilization , there was a median improvement of @ % in time taken and @ % in number of errors made from the first to the second attempt ; however , with the software turned on , there was a statistically significant deterioration of @ % ( P = @ ) in time taken and an increase in errors made of @ % ( P = ns ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the software corrects the view to that preferred during surgery , the endoscopic control mechanism as well as the exit point of the instrument are altered in this process , leading to a deterioration of overall performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Potential solutions include deploying intermittent horizon stabilization or using a robotic interface to achieve fully aligned perceptual-motor control .

BACKGROUND	Below-knee amputees commonly experience asymmetrical gait patterns and develop comorbidities in their intact and residual legs .
BACKGROUND	Carbon fiber prosthetic feet have been developed to minimize these asymmetries by utilizing elastic energy storage and return to provide body support , forward propulsion and leg swing initiation .
BACKGROUND	However , how prosthetic foot stiffness influences walking characteristics is not well-understood .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to identify the influence of foot stiffness on kinematics , kinetics , muscle activity , prosthetic energy storage and return , and mechanical efficiency during amputee walking .
METHODS	A comprehensive biomechanical analysis was performed on @ unilateral below-knee amputees .
METHODS	Subjects walked overground at @ m/s with three prosthetic feet of varying keel and heel stiffness levels , which were created using additive manufacturing .
RESULTS	As stiffness decreased , peak residual and intact leg ankle angles and residual leg knee flexion angle increased .
RESULTS	The residual and intact leg braking ground reaction forces and knee extensor moments , residual leg vastus and gluteus medius activity , and intact leg vastus and rectus femoris activity also increased .
RESULTS	The second vertical ground reaction force peak and hamstring activity in the residual leg and first vertical ground reaction force peak in the intact leg decreased .
RESULTS	In addition , prosthetic energy storage and return increased and mechanical efficiency decreased as stiffness decreased .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreasing foot stiffness can increase prosthesis range of motion , mid-stance energy storage and late-stance energy return , but the net contributions to forward propulsion and swing initiation may be limited as additional muscle activity to provide body support becomes necessary .

BACKGROUND	The inability to provide effective postoperative analgesia is one of the major disadvantages of intravenous regional anesthesia ( IVRA ) .
BACKGROUND	We designed a prospective , randomized , double blind study to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of adding both ketorolac and dexamethasone to lidocaine for IVRA .
METHODS	The study involved @ patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery .
METHODS	They were randomly allocated into three groups : Group L , Group LK and Group LDK .
METHODS	Group L received @ mg x kg-@ lidocaine ; Group LK received @ mg x kg-@ lidocaine + @ mg ketorolac ; and Group LDK received @ mg x kg-@ lidocaine for IVRA + @ mg dexamethasone + @ mg ketorolac for IVRA using a @ mL solution .
METHODS	Sensory and motor block onset and recovery times were recorded .
METHODS	Tourniquet pain and pain at the operative site were assessed by a visual analog scale .
METHODS	In the first @ h after surgery , opioid requirements and total analgesic consumption , including side effects , were noted .
RESULTS	Sensory and motor block onset and recovery times were similar in all groups .
RESULTS	Patients in Groups LK and LDK required less alfentanyl for control of intraoperative and early postoperative pain .
RESULTS	Further , patients in Groups LK and LDK reported significantly lower pain scores compared to those in Group L ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients in Groups LK and LDK required fewer postoperative ketorolac tablets ( @ + / -@ and @ + / -@ tablets , respectively ) in the first @ h after surgery and had significantly longer periods during which they required no analgesics ( @ min and @ min , respectively ) compared to those in Group L ( @ + / -@ tablets ; @ min , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	IVRA with lidocaine and with the inclusion of ketorolac and dexamethasone provides effective perioperative analgesia for patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery , when compared to the use of lidocaine alone or lidocaine with ketorolac IVRA .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of intratesticular administration of lidocaine on cardiovascular responses and cremaster muscle tension during castration of isoflurane-anesthetized stallions .
METHODS	@ healthy stallions ( mean + / - SD age , @ + / - @ years ) with no testicular abnormalities that were scheduled for castration .
METHODS	Each horse was given acepromazine ( @ microg/kg , IM ) , romifidine ( @ microg/kg , IV ) , and butorphanol ( @ microg/kg , IV ) .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with ketamine ( @ mg/kg , IV ) and midazolam ( @ microg/kg , IV ) and maintained with isoflurane ( @ % end-tidal concentration ) .
METHODS	After @ minutes at a stable anesthetic plane , a needle was placed in each testicle and either no fluid or @ mL of @ % lidocaine was injected ; @ minutes after needle placement , surgery was commenced .
METHODS	Pulse rate and arterial blood pressures were measured invasively at intervals from @ minutes prior to castration ( baseline ) until @ minutes after the left spermatic cord was clamped .
METHODS	The surgeon subjectively scored the degree of cremaster muscle tension .
METHODS	In @ horses , lidocaine labeled with radioactive carbon ( C ( @ ) ) was used and testicular autoradiograms were obtained .
RESULTS	Compared with baseline values , castration significantly increased blood pressure measurements ; intratesticular injection of lidocaine decreased this blood pressure response and cremaster muscle tension .
RESULTS	In @ horses , autoradiography revealed diffuse distribution of lidocaine into the spermatic cord but poor distribution into the cremaster muscle .
CONCLUSIONS	In isoflurane-anesthetized stallions , intratesticular injection of lidocaine prior to castration appeared to decrease intraoperative blood pressure responses and cremaster muscle tension and may be a beneficial supplement to isoflurane anesthesia .

METHODS	Postmenopausal women ( n = @ ) aged @-@ years with low bone density and normal mammograms were randomly assigned to two doses of lasofoxifene ( @ and @ mg ) or placebo .
METHODS	The primary endpoints of the PEARL trial were incidence of ER + breast cancer and nonvertebral fractures at @ years .
METHODS	A nested case-control study of @ incident breast cancer case patients and @ unaffected control subjects from the PEARL trial was performed to evaluate treatment effects on risk of total and ER + invasive breast cancer by baseline serum estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin levels using logistic regression models .
METHODS	Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate risk of total breast cancer and ER + invasive breast cancer using intention-to-treat analysis .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	Breast cancer was confirmed in @ women .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , @ mg of lasofoxifene statistically significantly reduced the risk of total breast cancer by @ % ( hazard ratio = @ ; @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ to @ ) and ER + invasive breast cancer by @ % ( hazard ratio = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The effects of @ mg of lasofoxifene on total breast cancer were similar regardless of Gail score , whereas the effects were markedly stronger for women with baseline estradiol levels greater than the median ( odds ratio = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ) vs those with levels less than the median ( odds ratio = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; P ( interaction ) = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A @-mg dose of lasofoxifene appears to reduce the risks of both total and ER + invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis .

BACKGROUND	The axilla is particularly associated with body odor and putative pheromone production in humans .
BACKGROUND	Although botulinum toxin type A ( BT-A ) is injected increasingly into the axillary skin to stop excessive sweating , its potential to control body odor is largely unexplored .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to measure the impact of BT-A on human axillary odor in an objective and reproducible fashion .
METHODS	This study was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial with @ healthy volunteers receiving @ U of BOTOX ( Allergan , Inc. ) in one axilla and placebo in the other .
METHODS	Odor quality was assessed by treated subjects ( questionnaire ) as well as by independent raters who were exposed to blinded T-shirt samples .
RESULTS	No major side effects occurred , and no subject withdrew from the study for medical reasons .
RESULTS	Samples from the BT-A-treated side smelled less intense ( p < @ ) and better ( p < @ ) according to self-assessments .
RESULTS	Likewise , independent raters found the BT-A-treated samples to smell less intense and better ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	They preferred `` to work together with the respective person '' and found the odor `` more erotic '' ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Side-by-side comparison of odor samples ( T-shirt sniff test ) by independent raters showed that axillary odor in healthy individuals is significantly more appealing after BT-A injection .

BACKGROUND	We sought to determine the potential of right ventricular VVI backup pacing to induce ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with implanted cardioverter-defibrillators .
RESULTS	All consecutive patients presenting exclusively with pacemaker-induced tachycardias ( PITs ) were included in a prospective study using a crossover protocol .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized to either group @ ( augmentation of the baseline frequency of the pacemaker to @ bpm ) or group @ ( pacemaker turned off ) and were followed up for @ year and then crossed over to the other programming , looking for reoccurrence of PIT .
RESULTS	Of @ consecutive patients , @ ( @ % ) had PIT , @ of them exclusively ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Forty of @ analyzed tachyarrhythmias of all the patients were PIT ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Before inclusion in the study , the patients had @ + / -@ PITs in @ + / -@ months with their pacemakers programmed empirically at @ bpm .
RESULTS	During the study phase , no PIT occurred while the pacemaker was turned off , whereas programming to @ bpm led to the recurrence of PIT in @ of @ patients ( @ + / -@ per patient ) .
RESULTS	At the end of the study , @ patients underwent a prolonged follow-up with their pacemakers turned off , resulting in spontaneous episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in @ patients , but PITs were no longer observed .
CONCLUSIONS	This crossover protocol proves the potential proarrhythmic effect of pacemaker stimulation in implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Resulting PITs led to clinical symptoms and antitachycardia therapy by the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , in patients presenting with PIT but without a pacemaker indication , the pacemaker feature should be turned off , or , alternatively , the longest possible escape interval should be programmed .

BACKGROUND	The rate of elective surgeries varies dramatically by geography in the United States .
BACKGROUND	For many of these surgeries , there is not clear evidence of their relative merits over alternate treatment choices and there are significant tradeoffs in short - and long-term risks and benefits of selecting one treatment option over another .
BACKGROUND	Conditions and symptoms for which there is this lack of a single clear evidence-based treatment choice present great opportunities for patient and provider collaboration on decision making ; back pain and joint osteoarthritis are two such ailments .
BACKGROUND	A number of decision aids are in active use to encourage this shared decision-making process .
BACKGROUND	Decision aids have been assessed in formal studies that demonstrate increases in patient knowledge , increases in patient-provider engagement , and reduction in surgery rates .
BACKGROUND	These studies have not widely demonstrated the added benefit of health coaching in support of shared decision making nor have they commonly provided strong evidence of cost reductions .
BACKGROUND	In order to add to this evidence base , we undertook a comparative study testing the relative impact on health utilization and costs of active outreach through interactive voice response technology to encourage health coaching in support of shared decision making in comparison to mailed outreach or no outreach .
BACKGROUND	This study focused on individuals with back pain or joint pain .
METHODS	We conducted four waves of stratified randomized comparisons for individuals with risk for back , hip , or knee surgery who did not have claims-based evidence of one or more of five chronic conditions and were eligible for population care management services within three large regional health plans in the United States .
METHODS	An interactive voice response ( IVR ) form of outreach that included the capability for individuals to directly connect with health coaches telephonically , known as AutoDialog ( ) , was compared to a control ( mailed outreach or natural levels of inbound calling depending on the study wave ) .
METHODS	In total , the study include @,@ adults with commercial and Medicare Advantage private coverage at three health plans and at risk for lumbar back surgery , hip repair/replacement , or knee repair/replacement .
RESULTS	Interactive voice response outreach led to @ ( P-value < @ ) times as many inbound calls within @ days as the control .
RESULTS	Over @ days , the IVR group ( `` intervention '' ) had @ percent ( P-value < @ ) more health coach communications and agreed to be sent @ ( P-value < @ ) time as many DVD - and/or booklet-based decision aids .
RESULTS	Targeted surgeries were reduced by @ percent ( P-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall costs were lower by @ percent ( P-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	Costs that were not related to maternity , cancer , trauma and substance abuse ( `` actionable costs '' ) were reduced by @ percent ( P-value = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	IVR with a transfer-to-health coach-option significantly increased levels of health coaching compared to mailed or no outreach and lead to significantly reduced actionable medical costs .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing high levels of health coaching to individuals with these types of risks appears to have produced important levels of actionable medical cost reductions .
CONCLUSIONS	We believe this impact resulted from more informed and engaged health care decision making .

BACKGROUND	Heart rate variability ( HRV ) has been used as a measure of stress and mental strain in surgeons .
BACKGROUND	Low HRV has been associated with death and increased risk of cardiac events in the general population .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of a @-hour night shift on surgeons ' HRV .
METHODS	Surgeons were monitored prospectively with an ambulatory electrocardiography device for @ consecutive hours , beginning on a precall day and continuing through an on-call ( @-h shift ) day .
METHODS	We measured HRV by frequency domain parameters .
RESULTS	We included @ surgeons in our analysis .
RESULTS	The median pulse rate was decreased precall ( median @ , interquartile range [ IQR ] @-@ beats per minute [ bpm ] ) compared with on call ( median @ , IQR @-@ bpm , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Increased high-frequency ( HF ) activity was found precall ( median @ , IQR @-@ ms@ ) compared with on call ( median @ , IQR @-@ ms@ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The low-frequency : high-frequency ( LF : HF ) ratio was lower precall ( median @ , IQR @-@ @ ) than on call ( median @ , IQR @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	We found no correlation between the LF : HF ratio and performance in laparoscopic simulation .
CONCLUSIONS	Surgeons working night shifts had a significant decrease in HRV and a significant increase in pulse rate , representing sympathetic dominance in the autonomic nervous system .
BACKGROUND	NCT@ ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ) .

OBJECTIVE	To explore the relationship between the administration of low-dose dopamine and outcomes in acute renal failure .
METHODS	Two hundred and fifty-six patients with acute renal failure randomized to the placebo arm of a multicenter intervention trial were examined .
METHODS	Independent correlates of low-dose ( arbitrarily defined as < @ micrograms/kg/min ) and high-dose ( arbitrarily defined as > or = @ micrograms/kg/min ) dopamine administration were identified .
METHODS	The relative risks of death , and the combined outcome of death or dialysis , were estimated using proportional hazards regression with and without adjustment for potential confounding and bias .
RESULTS	There were @ ( @ % ) deaths documented ; an additional @ ( @ % ) patients who survived required dialysis during the @-day study period .
RESULTS	The relative risk ( RR ) of death associated with the administration of low-dose dopamine was @ ( @ % confidence interval [ @ % Cl ] @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The RR of death was modestly but not significantly reduced , after adjustment for the probability of treatment assignment and for relevant covariates ( RR @ , @ % Cl @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The RR of death or dialysis associated with the administration of low-dose dopamine was @ ( @ % Cl @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The RR of death or dialysis was attenuated by adjustment , but not significantly ( RR @ , @ % Cl @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There is insufficient evidence that the administration of low-dose dopamine improves survival or obviates the need for dialysis in persons with acute renal failure .
CONCLUSIONS	The routine use of low-dose dopamine should be discouraged until a prospective , randomized , placebo-controlled trial establishes its safety and efficacy .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the difference in the efficacy on spasmodic torticollis between matrix needling technique combined with puncturing `` Wuxin points '' and the local injection of botox type A.
METHODS	Forty-two cases were randomized into an acupuncture group and a botox group , @ cases in each one .
METHODS	In the acupuncture group , the matrix needling technique was used and acupuncture was adopted at Fengchi ( GB @ ) , `` Wuxin points '' [ Shuigou ( GV @ ) , bilateral Laogong ( PC @ ) and bilateral Yongquan ( KI @ ) ] and local Ashi points .
METHODS	In the botox group , botox type A was injected at several spots of local region .
METHODS	The treatment course was @ month in the two groups .
METHODS	The efficacy in each weekend and the results of follow-up visit in half a year after treatment were compared between the two groups .
RESULTS	In the @st weekend , the markedly effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) and the total effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the botox group , which were better than those of @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) respectively in the acupuncture group ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the @nd weekend , the markedly effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) and the total effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the botox group , which were better than those of @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) respectively in the acupuncture group ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the @rd weekend , the markedly effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) and the total effective rate was @ % ( @/@ ) in the botox group , which were better than those of @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) respectively in the acupuncture group ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The markedly effective rate and the total effective rate were not different significantly between the two groups in the treatment of @ month and the follow-up visit in half a year ( all P > @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no adverse reaction in the acupuncture group .
RESULTS	There were @ cases of adverse reactions in the botox group , in which @ cases of neck muscular weakness and @ cases of neck muscular pain .
CONCLUSIONS	The treatment of matrix needling technique and combined with acupuncture at `` Wuxin points '' achieves the significant efficacy on spasmodic torticollis .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the effect is not obtained as quickly as the local injection of botox , the efficacy of matrix needling technique is similar to that of botox in the treatment of @ month and the follow-up visit in half a year .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , this therapy has no adverse reaction .

###25541155
BACKGROUND	This study evaluates persistence and severity of docetaxel-induced neuropathy ( peripheral neuropathy ( PN ) ) and impact on health related quality of life in survivors from early-stage breast cancer .
METHODS	One thousand and thirty-one patients with early-stage breast cancer , who received at least one cycle of docetaxel and provided information on PN during treatment , completed questionnaires on PN as an outcome ( Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) scores , European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy @ ( EORTC CIPN@ ) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire ( QLQ ) - C@ ) after @-@years .
RESULTS	Upon completion of docetaxel treatment , @ patients ( @ % ) reported PN , grades @-@ .
RESULTS	PN persisted for @-@years among @ ( @ % ) while PN regressed to grades @-@ among @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Among @ patients ( @ % ) without PN , @ ( @ % ) developed PN @-@years later while @ ( @ % ) stayed free from PN .
RESULTS	Significant risk factors for persistent PN were age @ ( p = @ ) , maximum grade of PN during docetaxel treatment ( p < @ ) , persistent muscle and joint pain ( p < @ ) , stomatitis ( p = @ ) and fatigue ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Persistent PN had a significant negative correlation with health-related quality of life ( HRQOL ) , functional scales and symptom scales .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , @ % of breast cancer survivors treated with docetaxel report PN @-@years after treatment with a significant negative impact on HRQOL .

###11599829
BACKGROUND	The purpose of our research was to evaluate the functional recovery and homeostasis of myocardium during simultaneous continuous retrograde and antegrade cardioplegia versus continuous retrograde cardioplegia .
METHODS	Forty patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) were prospectively assigned to two clinically matched groups and analyzed in respect to cardioplegia protocol .
METHODS	Group I consisted of @ patients who received continuous retrograde blood cardioplegia ; Group II consisted of @ patients who received simultaneous continuous ante - and retrograde cardioplegia .
METHODS	Hydrogen ion release , carbon dioxide , lactate concentration oxygen content , and oxygen extraction were measured from coronary sinus effluent and from the arterial line before and after cross-clamping of the aorta .
METHODS	Median changes of these parameters were reported .
METHODS	Cardiac output was measured and left and right ventricle stroke works were calculated .
METHODS	Incidence of low cardiac output , ventricular fibrillation , raised cardiac enzymes , and ischemic changes on electrocardiogram ( ECG ) were noted .
RESULTS	In the simultaneous group , oxygen content and oxygen extraction recovered well after cross-clamping .
RESULTS	The same parameters did not recover to the same extent in the retrograde group .
RESULTS	These changes were notable between groups .
RESULTS	Hydrogen ion , carbon dioxide , and lactate releases were comparable between groups .
RESULTS	Trend toward better recovery of left ventricle stroke work index was encountered in the simultaneous group .
CONCLUSIONS	Viability of myocardium measured with oxygen utilization and functional recovery is better preserved with simultaneous antegrade and retrograde cardioplegia .
CONCLUSIONS	However , there is no difference in anaerobic metabolism markers .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus simultaneous ante - and retrograde cardioplegia is probably advantageous over retrograde alone .

###10994901
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine , in a randomized clinical trial of @ individuals with knee osteoarthritis , the incremental cost-effectiveness of aerobic versus weight resistance training , compared with an education control intervention .
METHODS	Cost estimates of the intervention were based upon the cost of purchasing from the community similar services to provide exercise or health education .
METHODS	Effect at @ months was measured using several variables , including : self-reported disability score , @-min walking distance , stair climb , lifting and carrying task , car task , and measures of pain frequency and pain intensity on ambulation and transfer .
RESULTS	The total cost of the educational intervention was $ @ per participant .
RESULTS	The aerobic exercise intervention cost $ @ per participant , and the resistance training intervention cost $ @ per participant .
RESULTS	On all but two of the outcome variables , the incremental savings per incremental effect for the resistance exercise group was greater than for the aerobic exercise group .
CONCLUSIONS	The data obtained from this study suggest that , compared with an education control , resistance training for seniors with knee osteoarthritis is more economically efficient than aerobic exercise in improving physical function .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the magnitude of the difference in efficiency between the two approaches is small .

BACKGROUND	The incidence of pruritus after elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia with subarachnoid morphine may be @-@ % , and is a common cause of maternal dissatisfaction .
BACKGROUND	Ondansetron has been shown to reduce pruritus but the effect is short-lived .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this randomized double-blind trial was to evaluate the anti-pruritic efficacy of granisetron compared with ondansetron .
METHODS	Eighty ASA I or II women undergoing elective caesarean section received spinal anaesthesia with @ % hyperbaric bupivacaine @ mg , fentanyl @ microg and preservative-free morphine @ microg .
METHODS	After delivery of the baby and clamping of the umbilical cord , they were randomised to receive granisetron @mg i.v. ( group G ) or ondansetron @ mg i.v. ( group O ) .
RESULTS	The two groups were similar for age , gestational age , height and weight .
RESULTS	According to visual analogue pruritus scores , patients in group G experienced less pruritus at @h ( P = @ ) and @h ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fewer patients in group G ( n = @ ) than group O ( n = @ ) required rescue anti-pruritic medication ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Satisfaction scores were also higher in group G than in group O ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in overall incidence of pruritus , nausea and vomiting , and visual analogue pain scores between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of granisetron @mg i.v. reduces the severity of pruritus and the use of rescue anti-pruritic medication , and improves satisfaction but does not reduce the overall incidence of pruritus in women who have received subarachnoid morphine @ microg compared to ondansetron @ mg i.v.

###20203321
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of our study was to investigate the effects of different doses of neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) on upper-extremity function in acute stroke patients with severe motor deficit .
METHODS	Sixty-six acute stroke patients were randomized to @ groups : high NMES , low NMES , or control .
METHODS	The low-NMES group received @ minutes of stimulation per day , and the high-NMES group received @ minutes per day , for @ weeks .
METHODS	The Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment Scale , Action Research Arm Test , and Motor Activity Log were used to assess the patients at baseline , @ weeks , and @ weeks post baseline ( follow-up ) .
RESULTS	Both NMES groups showed significant improvement on Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment and Action Research Arm Test scales compared with the control group at week @ and follow-up .
RESULTS	The high-NMES group showed treatment effects similar to those of the low-NMES group .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher and lower doses of NMES led to similar improvements in motor function .
CONCLUSIONS	A minimum of @ hours of NMES in combination with regular rehabilitation may improve recovery of arm function in stroke patients during the acute stage .

BACKGROUND	Plasmodium vivax forms long-lasting hypnozoites in the liver .
BACKGROUND	How much they contribute to the burden of P. vivax malaria in children living in highly endemic areas is unknown .
METHODS	In this study , @ Papua New Guinean children aged @-@ years were Randomized to receive artesunate ( @ days ) plus primaquine ( @ days ) , artesunate alone or no treatment and followed up actively for recurrent Plasmodium infections and disease for @ weeks .
RESULTS	Treatment with artesunate-primaquine reduced the risk of P. vivax episodes by @ % ( P = @ ) and @ % ( P = @ ) compared with the artesunate and control arms , respectively .
RESULTS	A significant reduction was observed only in the first @ months of follow-up ( artesunate-primaquine vs control , -@ % [ P = @ ] ; artesunate-primaquine vs artesunate , -@ % [ P = @ ] ) with little difference thereafter .
RESULTS	Primaquine treatment also reduced the risk of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction - and light microscopy-positive P. vivax reinfections by @ % ( P < @ ) and @ % ( P < @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Whereas primaquine treatment did not change the risk of reinfection with Plasmodium falciparum , fewer P. falciparum clinical episodes were observed in the artesunate-primaquine arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Hypnozoites are an important source of P. vivax infection and contribute substantially to the high burden of P. vivax disease observed in young Papua New Guinean children .
CONCLUSIONS	Even in highly endemic areas with a high risk of reinfection , antihypnozoite treatment should be given to all cases with parasitologically confirmed P. vivax infections .

BACKGROUND	Reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction , understood to reduce mortality by preserving left ventricular function , was initially expected to provide increasing benefits over time .
BACKGROUND	Surprisingly , large controlled thrombolysis trials demonstrated maximum benefit at @ to @ weeks with no subsequent increased treatment advantage .
BACKGROUND	Such studies , however , compared groups by assigned treatment , not physiological effectiveness .
RESULTS	We calculated @-year survival differences among @ myocardial infarction patients according to early infarct artery patency and outcome left ventricular ejection fraction using Kaplan-Meier curves .
RESULTS	Hazard ratios for significant survival determinants were derived from Cox regression models .
RESULTS	Two-year vital status ( minimum , @ days ) was determined in @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	A substantial mortality advantage for early complete reperfusion ( Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [ TIMI ] grade @ ) and for preserved ejection fraction occurred beyond @ days .
RESULTS	The unadjusted hazard ratio for the TIMI @ group compared with lesser grades at @ days was @ ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] , @ to @ ) and @ days to > or = @ days was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Consequently , early TIMI @ flow was associated with approximately a @ patient per @ mortality reduction the first month with an additional @ lives per @ from @ days to @ years .
RESULTS	For ejection fraction > @ % compared with < or = @ % , the unadjusted hazard ratio was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) at @ days and @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) after @ days through @ years ( lives saved , approximately @ and @ per @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Successful reperfusion and myocardial salvage produce significant mortality benefits that are amplified beyond the initial @ days .

###21734179
OBJECTIVE	The therapeutic effects of @-aminopyridine ( @AP ) were investigated in a randomized , double-blind , crossover trial in @ subjects with familial episodic ataxia with nystagmus .
METHODS	After randomization , placebo or @AP ( @ mg @ times daily ) was administered for @ @-month-long treatment periods separated by a @-month-long washout period .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was the number of ataxia attacks per month ; the secondary outcome measures were the attack duration and patient-reported quality of life ( Vestibular Disorders Activities of Daily Living Scale [ VDADL ] ) .
METHODS	Nonparametric tests and a random-effects model were used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	The diagnosis of episodic ataxia type @ ( EA@ ) was genetically confirmed in @ subjects .
RESULTS	Patients receiving placebo had a median monthly attack frequency of @ , whereas patients taking @AP had a frequency of @ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median monthly attack duration decreased from @ hours with placebo to @ hours with @AP ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The VDADL score decreased from @ to @ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@AP was well-tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	This controlled trial on EA@ and familial episodic ataxia with nystagmus demonstrated that @AP decreases attack frequency and improves quality of life .
METHODS	This crossover study provides Class II evidence that @AP decreases attack frequency and improves the patient-reported quality of life in patients with episodic ataxia and related familial ataxias .

###25589191
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess the effect of afatinib on overall survival of patients with EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma through an analysis of data from two open-label , randomised , phase @ trials .
METHODS	Previously untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in LUX-Lung @ ( n = @ ) and LUX-Lung @ ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	These patients were randomly assigned in a @:@ ratio to receive afatinib or chemotherapy ( pemetrexed-cisplatin [ LUX-Lung @ ] or gemcitabine-cisplatin [ LUX-Lung @ ] ) , stratified by EGFR mutation ( exon @ deletion [ del@ ] , Leu@Arg , or other ) and ethnic origin ( LUX-Lung @ only ) .
METHODS	We planned analyses of mature overall survival data in the intention-to-treat population after @ ( LUX-Lung @ ) and @ ( LUX-Lung @ ) deaths .
METHODS	These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , numbers NCT@ and NCT@ .
RESULTS	Median follow-up in LUX-Lung @ was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) ; @ ( @ % ) of @ patients had died .
RESULTS	Median follow-up in LUX-Lung @ was @ months ( IQR @-@ ) ; @ ( @ % ) of @ patients had died .
RESULTS	In LUX-Lung @ , median overall survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the afatinib group and @ months ( @-@ @ ) in the pemetrexed-cisplatin group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In LUX-Lung @ , median overall survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the afatinib group and @ months ( @-@ @ ) in the gemcitabine-cisplatin group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , in preplanned analyses , overall survival was significantly longer for patients with del@-positive tumours in the afatinib group than in the chemotherapy group in both trials : in LUX-Lung @ , median overall survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) in the afatinib group versus @ months ( @-@ @ ) in the chemotherapy group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) ; in LUX-Lung @ , it was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) versus @ months ( @-@ @ ) , respectively ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	By contrast , there were no significant differences by treatment group for patients with EGFR Leu@Arg-positive tumours in either trial : in LUX-Lung @ , median overall survival was @ months ( @-@ @ ) in the afatinib group versus @ months ( @-not estimable ) in the chemotherapy group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) ; in LUX-Lung @ , it was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) versus @ months ( @-@ @ ) , respectively ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In both trials , the most common afatinib-related grade @-@ adverse events were rash or acne ( @ [ @ % ] of @ patients in LUX-Lung @ and @ [ @ % ] of @ patients in LUX-Lung @ ) , diarrhoea ( @ [ @ % ] and @ [ @ % ] ) , paronychia ( @ [ @ % ] in LUX-Lung @ only ) , and stomatitis or mucositis ( @ [ @ % ] in LUX-Lung @ only ) .
RESULTS	In LUX-Lung @ , neutropenia ( @ [ @ % ] of @ patients ) , fatigue ( @ [ @ % ] ) and leucopenia ( nine [ @ % ] ) were the most common chemotherapy-related grade @-@ adverse events , while in LUX-Lung @ , the most common chemotherapy-related grade @-@ adverse events were neutropenia ( @ [ @ % ] of @ patients ) , vomiting ( @ [ @ % ] ) , and leucopenia ( @ [ @ % ] ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although afatinib did not improve overall survival in the whole population of either trial , overall survival was improved with the drug for patients with del@ EGFR mutations .
CONCLUSIONS	The absence of an effect in patients with Leu@Arg EGFR mutations suggests that EGFR del@-positive disease might be distinct from Leu@Arg-positive disease and that these subgroups should be analysed separately in future trials .

OBJECTIVE	We studied the role of open surgery versus percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) in the treatment of complete staghorn stones in a prospective randomized manner .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with @ complete staghorn stones , defined as filling the entire collecting system or at least @ % of it , were prospectively randomized for PCNL ( @ ) or open surgery ( @ ) .
METHODS	Intraoperative and postoperative morbidity , operative time , hospital stay , and stone clearance at discharge home and followup were compared for both methods .
METHODS	Patients with significant residuals in both groups were subjected to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( Dornier Medical Systems , Inc. , Marietta , Georgia ) on an outpatient basis .
METHODS	Followup was completed for all cases with a mean duration + / - SD of @ + / - @ months ( range @ to @ ) .
METHODS	Renal function was evaluated by Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renogram before and after treatment in both groups .
RESULTS	Intraoperative complications in terms of bleeding requiring blood transfusion , and pleural , vascular or ureteral injuries were recorded in @ patients ( @ % ) in the PCNL and @ ( @ % ) in the open surgery groups , a difference of significant value ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Major postoperative complications including massive hematuria requiring blood transfusion , septicemia , urinary leakage and wound infection were observed in @ patients ( @ % ) in the PCNL group and in @ ( @ % ) in the open surgery group , a difference of no significant value .
RESULTS	PCNL was associated with shorter operative time ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ minutes , p < @ ) , shorter hospital stay ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ days , p < @ ) and earlier return to work ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ weeks , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	On the other hand both treatment groups were comparable in regard to stone-free rates at discharge home ( @ % vs @ % ) and at followup ( @ % vs @ % ) .
RESULTS	At followup renal function improved or remained stable in @ % and @ % in the PCNL and open surgery groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	PCNL is a valuable treatment option for complete staghorn stones with a stone-free rate approaching that of open surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , it has the advantages of lower morbidity , shorter operative time , shorter hospital stay and earlier return to work .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , which is a useful indicator of cardiovascular disease , can predict the hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and surgical stimulation in surgical patients .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized study .
METHODS	Operating rooms at a university hospital .
METHODS	@ ASA physical status I and II female patients presenting for elective gynecologic surgery .
METHODS	Patients who received one of the following anesthesia techniques were studied ; isoflurane , sevoflurane and sevoflurane with nitrous oxide ( N@O ) .
RESULTS	Patients underwent preoperative PWV measurements using an automatic PWV measurement device .
RESULTS	Systolic blood pressure and heart rate levels were recorded at baseline , during anesthesia , and at skin incision .
RESULTS	PWV had no significant correlation with percent changes of systolic blood pressure or heart rate , even after controlling the choice of anesthetic drugs .
CONCLUSIONS	Preoperative PWV fails to predict hemodynamic responses to anesthesia and to surgical stimulation .

BACKGROUND	Despite new anesthetic drugs and antiemetics , particularly @-hydroxytryptamines , the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting remains between @ % and @ % .
BACKGROUND	The authors tested the hypothesis that supplemental perioperative oxygen administration reduces the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting .
METHODS	Patients undergoing colon resection were anesthetized with fentanyl and isoflurane .
METHODS	During and for @ h after surgery they were randomly assigned to ( @ ) @ % oxygen , balance nitrogen ( n = @ ) ; or ( @ ) @ % oxygen , balance nitrogen ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The incidence of nausea or vomiting during the first @ postoperative hours was evaluated by nurses blinded to group assignment and oxygen concentration .
METHODS	Data were analyzed with unpaired t or Mann-Whitney U tests .
METHODS	Results are presented as means + / - SD ; P < @ was considered significant .
RESULTS	Factors known to influence nausea and vomiting were comparable in the two groups .
RESULTS	Perioperative oxygen saturation was well within normal limits in each treatment group ; saturations the first postoperative morning were comparable in each group .
RESULTS	Supplemental oxygen reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting from @ % in the patients given @ % oxygen to @ % in those given @ % oxygen ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Supplemental oxygen reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting nearly twofold after colorectal surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	The mechanism by which oxygen administration reduces the incidence of these postoperative sequelae remains unknown but may be related to subtle intestinal ischemia .
CONCLUSIONS	Because oxygen is inexpensive and essentially risk-free , supplemental oxygen appears to be an effective method of reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting .

BACKGROUND	Allergic symptoms are generally caused by exposure to substances to which people have become sensitized .
BACKGROUND	Associated with this is an ` unbalanced ' Th@/Th@ immune response with T cell responses skewed towards the production of Th@ cytokines , IL-@ , @ , and @ and high levels of IgE antibodies .
BACKGROUND	Current immune modulating therapies require the use of allergens , carrying the risk to induce potentially severe allergic reactions .
OBJECTIVE	Goal of the present study was to assess the safety and efficacy of an allergen-free immune modulator in patients suffering from perennial allergy .
METHODS	In order to be protected from immediate degradation upon injection , a toll-like receptor @ ( TLR@ ) agonist was packaged into virus-like particles .
METHODS	These nanoparticles loaded with TLR@ ligands ( CYT@-QbG@ ) were injected six times , at weekly intervals , into patients with house dust mite allergy in an attempt to ameliorate allergic symptoms by modifying the immune response towards allergens .
METHODS	Two different doses were compared against placebo in this double-blind , randomized phase IIb study ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Public trial registry : http://clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT@ ) .
RESULTS	The treatment was safe and generally well tolerated .
RESULTS	Rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were significantly lower in patients treated with high dose of CYT@-QbG@ as compared with placebo ( scores @ vs. @ , P = @ ) based on a standardized average combined symptom and medication score .
RESULTS	Furthermore , patients in the high dose group reported a significantly better quality of life score post-treatment than patients on placebo ( scores @ vs. @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The conjunctival provocation test revealed a median @-fold increase in allergen tolerance in the high dose group while in the placebo group it remained unchanged .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with high-dose CYT@-QbG@ improved disease symptoms and reduced medication use in allergic individuals thus providing first evidence for a new potential immunotherapeutic .

BACKGROUND	It is unclear whether a marked reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) in patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and mild hypercholesterolemia leads to less progression of atherosclerosis .
RESULTS	Patients with CHD and hypercholesterolemia ( @ < LDL-C < @ mg/dl ) who underwent coronary angiography ( CAG ) and intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) were randomly assigned to the atorvastatin ( @-@ mg/day ) group or ; usual care ' group .
RESULTS	After @ months @ patients had follow-up CAG and IVUS studies that could be evaluated .
RESULTS	Cross-sectional areas of the vessel , lumen , and plaque were measured at @-mm intervals , and volumetric calculations were based on Simpson 's rule .
RESULTS	After @ months , the mean reduction of LDL-C was @ % in the atorvastatin group and @ % in the usual care group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean absolute plaque volume showed a larger increase in the usual care group than in the atorvastatin group ( atorvastatin -@ + / -@ mm@ , usual care @ + / -@ mm@ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Vessel volume also showed a larger increase in the usual care group than in the atorvastatin group ( atorvastatin @ + / -@ mm@ , usual care @ + / -@ mm@ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Atorvastatin treatment prevented the further progression of atherosclerosis by maintaining LDL-C below @ mg/dl in patients with CHD and hypercholesterolemia ( @ < LDL-C < @ mg/dl ) .

BACKGROUND	Medium chain C@-C@ triglycerides ( MCTs ) improve fat absorption in short bowel patients .
BACKGROUND	Effects on overall energy absorption remain unknown .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether MCTs and medium chain fatty acids ( MCFAs ) are absorbed in the colon like the short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) or are lost in faeces similarly to long chain fatty acids ( LCFAs ) .
METHODS	Nine small bowel resected patients without and @ with a colon in continuity excreted @-@ MJ/day and were randomised and crossed over between two high fat diets ( @ MJ/day , @ % as fat ) , based on either long chain triglycerides ( LCT ) alone or equal quantities of LCT and MCT .
RESULTS	Patients with a colon absorbed C@-C@ fatty acids considerably better than patients without a colon at similar and extreme levels of LCFA malabsorption ; the colonic impact on absorption of C@-@ fatty acids was negligible .
RESULTS	MCT redoubled fat ( MCT+LCT ) absorption from @ % to @ % in patients with a colon , and increased overall bomb calorimetric energy absorption from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	The increase in fat absorption from @ % to @ % in patients without a colon did not improve overall energy absorption because malabsorption of carbohydrate and protein increased .
CONCLUSIONS	In small bowel resected patients , the colon seems to serve as a digestive organ for medium chain fat , probably absorbed as MCFAs , perhaps because like the SCFAs , they are water soluble .
CONCLUSIONS	Only patients with a colon gained from MCT treatment .

BACKGROUND	Wholegrain rye has been associated with decreased hunger sensations .
BACKGROUND	This may be partly mediated by colonic fermentation .
BACKGROUND	Sustained consumption of fermentable components is known to change the gut microflora and may increase numbers of saccharolytic bacteria .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of wholegrain rye consumption on appetite and colonic fermentation after a subsequent meal .
METHODS	In a randomized , controlled , three-arm cross-over study , twelve healthy male subjects consumed three iso-caloric evening test meals .
METHODS	The test meals were based on white wheat bread ( WBB ) , wholegrain rye kernel bread ( RKB ) , or boiled rye kernels ( RK ) .
METHODS	Breath hydrogen excretion and subjective appetite sensation were measured before and at @min intervals for @h after a standardized breakfast in the subsequent morning .
METHODS	After the @h , an ad libitum lunch meal was served to assess energy intake .
METHODS	In an in vitro study , RKB and RK were subjected to digestion and @h-fermentation in order to study SCFA production and growth of selected saccharolytic bacteria .
RESULTS	The test meals did not differ in their effect on parameters of subjective appetite sensation the following day .
RESULTS	Ad libitum energy intake at lunch was , however , reduced by @ % ( P < @ ) after RKB and @ % ( P < @ ) after RK compared with after WWB evening meal .
RESULTS	Breath hydrogen excretion was significantly increased following RKB and RK evening meals compared with WWB ( P < @ and P < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Overall , RKB and RK were readily fermented in vitro and exhibited similar fermentation profiles , although total SCFA production was higher for RK compared with RKB ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In vitro fermentation of RKB and RK both increased the relative quantities of Bifidobacterium and decreased Bacteroides compared with inoculum ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The C. coccoides group was reduced after RKB ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of wholegrain rye products reduced subsequent ad libitum energy intake in young healthy men , possibly mediated by mechanisms related to colonic fermentation .

OBJECTIVE	Auto-continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) has been reported to have no more efficacy than constant CPAP in unselected patients with sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome ( SAHS ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate patients judged to be good candidates for auto-CPAP because of a high within-night variability in pressure requirement .
METHODS	Single-blind , randomized , cross-over study ( @ x @ weeks ) to compare auto-CPAP with constant CPAP .
METHODS	Outpatients with moderate-to-severe SAHS attending the chest clinic .
METHODS	Patients were equipped at home in the auto-CPAP mode ( model GK@A ; Malinckrodt ; Nancy , France ) , using a @ - to @-cm H ( @ ) O pressure range .
METHODS	Those individuals having a high within-night variability in pressure requirement , assessed at the end of a @-day run-in period , were included in the cross-over study .
METHODS	Auto-CPAP was compared with constant CPAP ( according to a titration night in the sleep laboratory ) in terms of compliance , efficacy on apneas ( assessed from the pressure monitor ) , and sleepiness ( assessed on the Epworth sleepiness scale ) .
RESULTS	Of @ consecutive patients with SAHS , @ patients were selected for a within-night variability in pressure requirement exceeding a given threshold .
RESULTS	After completion of the cross-over , @ patients were evaluable .
RESULTS	The median percentage of nights the machine was used was @ % ( range , @ to @ % ) on constant CPAP , and @ % ( range , @ to @ % ) on auto-CPAP ; the median apnea index recorded by the device was @ / h ( range , @ to @ / h ) on constant CPAP , and @ / h ( range , @ to @ / h ) on auto-CPAP ( differences not significant ) .
RESULTS	The mean Epworth sleepiness score was significantly ( p < @ ) lower on auto-CPAP ( @ ; SD , @ ) than on constant CPAP ( @ ; SD , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients selected for a high within-night variability in pressure requirement , auto-CPAP administered via a GK@A device was equivalent to constant CPAP based on a titration night in the sleep laboratory .
CONCLUSIONS	Subjective ratings for sleepiness were slightly lower on auto-CPAP .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the prevalence and clinical predictors of silent myocardial ischemia in asymptomatic patients with type @ diabetes and to test the effectiveness of current American Diabetes Association screening guidelines .
METHODS	In the Detection of Ischemia in Asymptomatic Diabetics ( DIAD ) study , @,@ patients with type @ diabetes , aged @-@ years , with no known or suspected coronary artery disease , were randomly assigned to either stress testing and @-year clinical follow-up or to follow-up only .
METHODS	The prevalence of ischemia in @ patients randomized to stress testing was assessed by adenosine technetium-@m sestamibi single-photon emission-computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( @ % ) had silent ischemia , including @ with regional myocardial perfusion abnormalities and @ with normal perfusion but other abnormalities ( i.e. , adenosine-induced ST-segment depression , ventricular dilation , or rest ventricular dysfunction ) .
RESULTS	Moderate or large perfusion defects were present in @ patients .
RESULTS	The strongest predictors for abnormal tests were abnormal Valsalva ( odds ratio [ OR ] @ ) , male sex ( @ ) , and diabetes duration ( @ ) .
RESULTS	Other traditional cardiac risk factors or inflammatory and prothrombotic markers were not predictive .
RESULTS	Ischemic adenosine-induced ST-segment depression with normal perfusion ( n = @ ) was associated with women ( OR @ ) .
RESULTS	Selecting only patients who met American Diabetes Association guidelines would have failed to identify @ % of patients with silent ischemia .
CONCLUSIONS	Silent myocardial ischemia occurs in greater than one in five asymptomatic patients with type @ diabetes .
CONCLUSIONS	Traditional and emerging cardiac risk factors were not associated with abnormal stress tests , although cardiac autonomic dysfunction was a strong predictor of ischemia .

BACKGROUND	Oxidation of LDL ( oxLDL ) is thought to have an important role in early stages of atherogenesis .
BACKGROUND	Antibody to oxLDL ( Ab-oxLDL ) has been proposed as a biomarker which might be directly associated with oxidative stress .
BACKGROUND	Yet studies designed to test this hypothesis are lacking .
BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that consumption of a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and reduced in saturated fat , total fat , and cholesterol will concomitantly reduce oxidative stress and Ab-oxLDL .
METHODS	One hundred and three healthy individuals were randomly assigned to consume a typical American ( control ) diet or the DASH diet rich in fruits , vegetables and low-fat dairy products and reduced in fat ( @ % ) , saturated fat ( @ % ) , and cholesterol ( @ mg/day ) for @ months .
METHODS	Outcomes were urinary isoprostanes ( in vivo marker of oxidative stress ) , oxygen radical absorbing capacity ( ORAC , an in vitro assay measuring antioxidant activity in serum ) , and Ab-oxLDL measured at baseline , @-@ months of feeding .
RESULTS	Compared to the control diet , consumption of the DASH diet significantly lowered urinary isoprostane ( -@ pg/ml , @ % CI : -@ to -@ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the control group , change in ORAC was higher in the DASH group , @ trolox units/ml ( @ % CI : -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In comparison with the control diet , increased titers of Ab-oxLDL ( @ mU/ml [ @ % CI : @-@ , P = @ ] ) were seen after consumption of the DASH diet .
RESULTS	Higher titers of Ab-oxLDL occurred at month @ ( @ mU/ml , @ % CI : @-@ , P = @ ) and month @ ( @ mU/ml , @ % CI : -@ to @ , P = @ ) , after initially small increases at month @ ( @ mU/ml , @ % CI : -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	End-of-study increases in AB-oxLDL were highly correlated with increased ORAC ( Spearman 's rho = @ , P < @ ) , but not with changes in specific carotenoids , tocopherols or with change in LDL cholesterol ( each : P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Consumption of a healthy diet replete in antioxidants reduced oxidative stress ( urinary isoprostanes ) yet increased Ab-oxLDL .
CONCLUSIONS	This indirect association of Ab-oxLDL with urinary isoprostanes hinders use of Ab-oxLDL as a marker of oxidative damage .

BACKGROUND	Postprandial metabolism is impaired in patients with type @ diabetes ( T@Dm ) .
BACKGROUND	Two thiazolidinediones pioglitazone ( PGZ ) and rosiglitazone ( RGZ ) have similar effects on glycaemic control but differ in their effects on fasting lipids .
BACKGROUND	This study investigated the effects of RGZ and PGZ on postprandial metabolism in a prospective , randomized crossover trial .
METHODS	Seventeen patients with T@Dm were randomized to RGZ or PGZ for @ weeks , with an @-week wash-out period .
METHODS	Fasting blood samples were taken for glucose ( FPG ) , insulin , HbA ( @c ) , lipids , apolipoproteins ( apo ) , lipoprotein ( LPL ) and hepatic lipase ( HL ) , and cholesterol ester transfer protein ( CETP ) activity .
METHODS	A standardized breakfast was served and postprandial glucose , insulin , and lipid subfraction profiles were determined .
RESULTS	RGZ and PGZ treatment resulted in a similar improvement in FPG , HbA ( @c ) and homeostasis model assessment .
RESULTS	Fasting and postprandial triglyceride ( TG ) levels were significantly lower following PGZ therapy ( fasting : -@ vs @ mmol/L ; p < @ ; postprandial AUC-TG : -@ vs @ mmol/L/min ; p < @ ) associated with changes in VLDL-@-TG ( -@ vs @ mmol/L ; p = @ ) and VLDL-@-TG ( @ vs @ mmol/L ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Fasting cholesterol increased with RGZ compared to PGZ ( @ vs @ mmol/L ; p < @ ) , particularly in VLDL-@-C ( -@ vs @ mmol/L ; p < @ ) and VLDL-@-C ( -@ vs @ mmol/L ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Postprandial VLDL lipid and protein content increased after RGZ and decreased after PGZ .
RESULTS	Fasting apoB , apoA-I , apoC-II/C-III-ratio , and LPL activity did not differ .
RESULTS	CETP activity decreased after RGZ and increased after PGZ ( -@ vs @ p/mol/mL / min ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both the glitazones had similar effects on glucose metabolism .
CONCLUSIONS	The additional beneficial effect of PGZ on lipid metabolism may be related to its effects on insulin-independent VLDL production and CETP activity .

OBJECTIVE	Our purpose was to determine whether in a low-dose aspirin trial a longitudinal decrease in maternal serum thromboxane B@ is associated with improvement in pregnancy outcomes .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy nulliparous women with singleton gestations were randomized at @ weeks to either @ mg of aspirin or a placebo .
METHODS	Maternal serum thromboxane B@ was measured at randomization , at @ to @ weeks , at @ to @ weeks , and at delivery .
METHODS	After delivery , and without knowledge of patient outcome or group assignment , patients were categorized as having had either a longitudinal twofold or greater ( > or = @ % ) or less than twofold reduction ( < @ % ) in thromboxane B@ from baseline levels at randomization .
RESULTS	Of @ entrants , @ % had sufficient thromboxane B@ determinations to allow categorization .
RESULTS	Whether patients were assigned to aspirin or placebo , birth weight was significantly greater in women who had a twofold or greater reduction in maternal serum thromboxane B@ levels .
RESULTS	When the aspirin and placebo groups were combined , women with a twofold or greater reduction in thromboxane B@ levels had less preeclampsia , @ % ( @/@ ) versus @ % ( @/@ ) ( p = @ ) , less preterm delivery ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) , fewer small-for-gestational-age newborns , @ of @ ( @ ) versus @ of @ ( @ % ) ( p = @ ) , and a higher mean birth weight , @ gm versus @ gm ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Women with a twofold or greater longitudinal reduction in maternal serum thromboxane B@ had less preeclampsia and prematurity , fewer small-for-gestational-age newborns , and higher birth weights than women with less than a twofold reduction .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether mental practice of wrist movements during forearm immobilization maintains range of motion .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy young men aged between @ and @ years were assigned to either a control or a mental practice group .
METHODS	Both groups were immobilized with a circular forearm cast for @ weeks to simulate a distal radial fracture .
METHODS	The mental practice group received @ @-min , followed by @ @-min , sessions of supervised mental practice .
METHODS	Consecutively , they were asked to perform @ min/day of self-guided imagery sessions , during which they mentally exercised motion sequences of the immobilized joint .
METHODS	The training program followed the Mental Gait Training procedure .
METHODS	The control group did no training .
METHODS	Wrist movement was measured with a goniometer before and after immobilization .
RESULTS	Mental practice preserved dorsal extension and ulnar abduction .
RESULTS	The sedentary control group showed due to this variables a significant decrease after cast removal .
RESULTS	There was no significant change in palmar flexion and radial abduction in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the study limitations , these results suggest that mental practice may be useful in preventing loss of hand function associated with mid-term immobilization .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of the expected clinical benefits , the low cost and simple application of the intervention , the effects of mental practice in orthopedic rehabilitation of the upper extremity warrant further study .

METHODS	The experimental group was instructed in the @ parts of the sports injury prevention training program and performed it during the first @ minutes of team practice for the next @ weeks , while the control group performed their regular training program .
METHODS	Both groups were tested with a rebound-jump task before and after the @-week period .
METHODS	A total of @ reflective markers were placed in preassigned positions .
METHODS	In this controlled laboratory study , a @-way analysis of variance ( @ x @ ) experimental design was used for the statistical analysis ( P < @ ) using the experimental group and a testing session as within and between factors , respectively .
METHODS	Post hoc tests with Sidak correction were used when significant factor effects and/or interactions were observed .
RESULTS	A comparison of the experimental group 's pretraining and posttraining results identified training effects on all strength parameters ( P = @ to @ ) and on knee flexion , which reflects increased flexibility ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The experimental group showed higher knee flexion angles ( P = @ ) , greater interknee distances ( P = @ ) , lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios ( P = @ ) , and lower maximum knee extension torques ( P = @ ) after training .
RESULTS	In the control group , no statistical differences were observed between pretraining and posttraining findings ( P = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	At pretraining , no significant differences were observed between the @ groups for any parameter ( P = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	However , a comparison of the @ groups after training revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher knee flexion angles ( P = @ ) , greater knee distances ( P = @ ) , lower hamstring-quadriceps ratios ( P = @ ) , lower maximum knee extension torques ( P = @ ) , and higher maximum knee abduction torques P ( = @ ) than the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The sports injury prevention training program improved the strength and flexibility of the competitive female basketball players tested and biomechanical properties associated with anterior cruciate ligament injury as compared with pretraining parameters and with posttraining parameters in the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	This injury prevention program could potentially modify the flexibility , strength , and biomechanical properties associated with ACL injury and lower the athlete 's risk for injury .

BACKGROUND	Several treatment options are available for patients with type @ diabetes mellitus who are making the transition from oral antidiabetes drugs ( OADs ) to insulin .
BACKGROUND	Two options currently recommended by the Canadian Diabetes Association for initiating insulin therapy in patients with type @ diabetes who are no longer responsive to OADs alone are insulin glargine plus OADs , and premixed insulin therapy only .
BACKGROUND	Because of differences in efficacy , adverse events ( such as hypoglycaemia ) and acquisition costs , these two treatment options may lead to different long-term clinical and economic outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the cost effectiveness of insulin glargine plus OADs compared with premixed insulin without OADs in insulin-naive patients with type @ diabetes in Canada .
METHODS	Using treatment effects taken from a published clinical trial , the validated IMS-CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate the long-term cost effectiveness of insulin glargine with OADs , versus premixed insulin .
METHODS	Input treatment effects for the two therapeutic approaches were based on changes in glycosylated haemoglobin A ( @c ) ( HbA ( @c ) ) at clinical trial endpoint , and hypoglycaemia rates .
METHODS	The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the Canadian Provincial payer .
METHODS	Direct treatment and complication costs were obtained from published sources ( primarily from Ontario ) and reported in $ Can , year @ values .
METHODS	All base-case costs and outcomes were discounted at @ % per year .
METHODS	Sensitivity analyses were conducted around key parameters and assumptions used in the study .
METHODS	Outcomes included direct medical costs associated with both treatment and diabetes-related complications .
METHODS	Cost-effectiveness outcomes included total average lifetime ( @ years ) costs , life expectancy ( LE ) , QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ( ICERs ) .
RESULTS	Base-case analyses showed that , compared with premixed insulin only , insulin glargine in combination with OADs was associated with a @-year increase in LE and a @ increase in QALYs .
RESULTS	Insulin glargine plus OADs showed a very slight increase in total direct costs ( $ Can @ + / - @ ) , resulting in ICERs of $ Can @ per life-year gained ( LYG ) and $ Can @ per QALY gained .
RESULTS	However , considerable uncertainty around the ICERs was demonstrated by insulin glargine having a @ % probability of being cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $ Can @,@ per QALY , and a @ % probability at a $ Can @,@ threshold .
RESULTS	Base-case results were most sensitive to assumed disutilities for hypoglycaemic events , to the assumed effect of insulin glargine plus OADs on HbA ( @c ) , and to its assumed acquisition costs .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings should be interpreted within the context of a large degree of uncertainty and of several study limitations that include a single clinical trial as the source for primary treatment assumptions and a single province as the source for most cost inputs .
CONCLUSIONS	Under current study assumptions and limitations , insulin glargine plus OADs was projected to be a cost-effective option , compared with premixed insulin only , for the treatment of insulin-naive patients with type @ diabetes unresponsive to OADs .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional work is needed to examine the generalizability of the findings to individual jurisdictions of the Canadian healthcare system .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate and compare the influences of micronized fenofibrate and atorvastatin on serum lipid profile , including lipoprotein ( a ) levels , and on fibrinogen levels in a large group of patients with primary mixed hyperlipidemia ( serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels > @ and @ mg/dl , respectively , and serum triglyceride level > @ mg/dl ) .
METHODS	This was a @-week , open-label , parallel-design study conducted in our lipid clinic .
METHODS	After a @-week dietary baseline phase , we implemented a treatment phase , during which patients received @ mg/day atorvastatin ( n = @ ) or @ mg/day micronized fenofibrate ( n = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients were assigned to one of the drugs in sequential orders .
METHODS	Serum lipid profiles , including levels of lipoprotein ( a ) and fibrinogen , as well as muscle and liver enzymes , were measured during screening , and during weeks -@ , -@ , @ , @ , and @ of the treatment period .
RESULTS	Atorvastatin was more effective than was micronized fenofibrate at lowering levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , whereas fenofibrate was more effective at lowering levels of triglycerides , and raising levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A@ .
RESULTS	However , micronized fenofibrate could significantly decrease plasma fibrinogen levels , whereas atorvastatin evoked a small increase .
CONCLUSIONS	Both atorvastatin in small doses and micronized fenofibrate are effective for improving serum lipid profiles of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia .
CONCLUSIONS	However , there are considerable differences between the two drugs concerning their influences on plasma fibrinogen levels .

BACKGROUND	Combined treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta@ agonists is approved for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , but little is known about the onset of effect of the combination .
METHODS	Data were used from @ patients with COPD entered into a large @ year double blind trial with daily measurements of peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) and symptom scores .
RESULTS	PEF was significantly higher after @ day in patients treated with salmeterol @ microg twice daily or the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination @/@ microg twice daily than placebo .
RESULTS	In patients treated with fluticasone propionate @ microg twice daily alone , PEF differed from placebo after @ days .
RESULTS	The differences after @ weeks compared with placebo were @ l/min ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @ to @ ) , @ l/min ( @ % CI @ to @ ) , and @ l/min ( @ % CI @ to @ ) for salmeterol , fluticasone propionate , and the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination , respectively .
RESULTS	For all treatments the effect on PEF after @ weeks was comparable to that seen at the end of the study .
RESULTS	The difference between the salmeterol/fluticasone propionate combination and placebo after @ weeks as a percentage of baseline was similar for PEF and clinic forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) .
RESULTS	Differences in breathlessness scores were statistically significant after @ day for the group treated with salmeterol alone and after @ days for the combination group .
RESULTS	The @ week change in FEV@ was only partly indicative of a long term response in individual patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects of salmeterol and fluticasone propionate , alone or in combination , on PEF and breathlessness are seen within days and most of the obtainable effect on these parameters is reached within @ weeks .

BACKGROUND	Autonomic dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis , treatment and prognosis of congestive heart failure ( CHF ) .
BACKGROUND	Sympathomimetic amines have been widely used in the treatment of CHF , but reports on their autonomic effects in CHF are rare .
BACKGROUND	This study was designed to evaluate the effects of dopamine and dobutamine on cardiac autonomic function as assessed by heart rate variability ( HRV ) .
METHODS	Twenty patients with symptomatic CHF ( systolic dysfunction ) were enrolled .
METHODS	After recording one-hour baseline electrocardiographs ( ECGs ) , patients were randomly selected for either dopamine ( @ micrograms/kg/minute , Group A ) or dobutamine ( @ micrograms/kg/minute , Group B ) treatment for three days .
METHODS	On the third day , a @-hour ambulatory ECG was recorded and a tilt-table test was performed .
METHODS	Only furosemide and nitrates were allowed for adjunctive therapy .
METHODS	HRV was measured before and after treatment in both time and frequency domains .
METHODS	Frequency-domain HRV was also measured during head-up tilt .
RESULTS	After treatment , all patients improved [ New York Heart Association fraction ( NYHA Fc ) @ to @ ] .
RESULTS	Group A patients had higher post-treatment @-hour HRV than those in Group B. SDNN ( standard deviation of the average normal RR intervals in the entire ECG recording ) , SDANN ( standard deviation of the average normal RR intervals for all five minute segments of an entire ECG recording ) and SDNN indices in Group A were significantly higher than in Group B ( @ + / - @ ms vs @ + / - @ ms , @ + / - @ ms vs @ + / - @ ms , and @ + / - @ ms vs @ + / - @ ms , respectively , all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	rMSSD ( the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal RR intervals over the entire ECG recording ) and pNN@ ( percentage of differences between adjacent normal RR intervals that are greater than @ ms computed over the entire ECG recording ) were also higher in Group A patients , with borderline significance .
RESULTS	All measurements of total frequency and low-frequency and high-frequency components tended to be higher in Group A than Group B , but this was only significant for total frequency amplitude ( @ + / - @ ms vs @ + / - @ ms , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Dopamine but not dobutamine treatment seems to restore the depressed circadian change in frequency-domain HRV classically seen in patients with CHF .
RESULTS	The HRV change during head-up tilting did not differ between the two groups .
RESULTS	Three patients in Group B showed non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on ambulatory ECG during the treatment period .
CONCLUSIONS	Dopamine and dobutamine have comparable therapeutic effects in patients with CHF , but low-dose dopamine more favorably affects cardiac autonomic function .

BACKGROUND	Alcohol screening , brief intervention , and referral to specialized treatment ( ASBIR ) reduce drinking and related harms .
BACKGROUND	Unanswered questions are how to manage nondependent patients with poor response to brief interventions , how to manage dependent patients who do not obtain treatment , and how to ensure population-wide delivery of ASBIR .
BACKGROUND	Telephone-administered counseling may provide answers .
METHODS	We conducted a @-month randomized controlled trial of a telephone and mail intervention for non-treatment-seeking primary care patients with alcohol use disorders .
METHODS	We enrolled @ subjects after systematic screening in @ primary care clinic waiting rooms in and around Madison and Milwaukee , Wisconsin , and subsequent telephone-administered diagnostic interviews .
METHODS	Experimental subjects received up to six sessions of protocol-driven telephone counseling based on principles of motivational interviewing and stages of readiness to change .
METHODS	Control subjects received a pamphlet on healthy lifestyles .
METHODS	The paper reports on @-month drinking outcomes for men and women with alcohol abuse and dependence .
RESULTS	Male experimental subjects ( N = @ ) manifested a @ % decline in risky drinking days , compared with a @ % decline in controls ( N = @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The total consumption declined by @ % compared with @ % by controls ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Female experimental subjects ( N = @ ) manifested a @ % decrease in risky drinking days compared with an @ % decrease by controls ( N = @ ; p = NS ) and a @ % decline in total consumption compared with @ % by controls ( p = NS ) .
RESULTS	Greater numbers of telephone counseling sessions were associated with greater declines in drinking .
CONCLUSIONS	Following systematic screening , a six-session telephone and mail intervention is more effective than a pamphlet in reducing drinking at @ months for non-treatment-seeking men with alcohol abuse and dependence .
CONCLUSIONS	An intervention effect of the enrollment procedures may have obscured further intervention effectiveness .
CONCLUSIONS	Telephone counseling shows promise for non-treatment-seeking primary care patients with alcohol use disorders .

BACKGROUND	Adaptive support ventilation ( ASV ) is a microprocessor-controlled mode of mechanical ventilation that maintains a predefined minute ventilation with an optimal breathing pattern ( tidal volume and rate ) by automatically adapting inspiratory pressure and ventilator rate to changes in the patient 's condition .
BACKGROUND	The aim of the current study was to test the hypothesis that a protocol of respiratory weaning based on ASV could reduce the duration of tracheal intubation after uncomplicated cardiac surgery ( `` fast-track '' surgery ) .
METHODS	A group of patients being given ASV ( group ASV ) was compared with a control group ( group control ) in a randomized controlled study .
METHODS	After coronary artery bypass grafting during general anesthesia with midazolam and fentanyl , patients were randomly assigned to group ASV or group control .
METHODS	Both protocols were divided into three predefined phases , and weaning progressed according to arterial blood gas and clinical criteria .
METHODS	In phase @ , ASV mode was set at @ % of the theoretical value of volume/minute in group ASV , and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation mode was used in group control .
METHODS	When spontaneous breathing occurred , ASV setting was reduced by @ % of minute ventilation ( phase @ ) and again by @ % ( phase @ ) , and the trachea was extubated .
METHODS	In group control , the ventilator was switched to @ cm H@O inspiratory pressure support ( phase @ ) , then to @ cm H@O ( phase @ ) until extubation .
RESULTS	Forty-nine patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	Sixteen patients completed the ASV protocol , and @ the standard protocol ; @ patients were excluded in group ASV and @ in group control according to explicit , predefined criteria .
RESULTS	There were no differences between groups in perioperative characteristics or in the doses of sedation .
RESULTS	The primary outcome of the study , that is , the duration of tracheal intubation , was shorter in group ASV than in group control ( median [ quartiles ] : @ [ @-@ @ ] vs. @ [ @-@ @ ] h ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Fewer arterial blood analyses were performed in group ASV ( median number [ quartiles ] : @ [ @-@ ] vs. @ [ @-@ ] ) , suggesting that fewer changes in the settings of the ventilator were required in this group .
CONCLUSIONS	A respiratory weaning protocol based on ASV is practicable ; it may accelerate tracheal extubation and simplify ventilatory management in fast-track patients after cardiac surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	The evaluation of potential advantages of the use of such technology on patient outcome and resource utilization deserves further studies .

BACKGROUND	A number of animal studies and our own clinical trials point towards a possible influence of the renin-angiotensin-system ( RAS ) on erythropoietin ( EPO ) production .
BACKGROUND	In this study we investigated the role of angiotensin II in the regulation of EPO production in humans .
METHODS	After a hemorrhage of @ ml as a basic physiological stimulus @ healthy male volunteers received in a parallel design either placebo ( physiologic electrolyte solution ) for @ h , angiotensin II i.v. for @ h ( @-@ microgram min-@ , sufficient to increase systolic blood pressure by @ mmHg ) , the selective AT@-receptor antagonist losartan , the ACE-inhibitor captopril , angiotensin II + losartan , or angiotensin II + captopril .
RESULTS	Administration of angiotensin II alone and in combination with captopril resulted in a significantly higher Cmax EPO ( @ % higher vs. placebo , P < @ ) and AUCEPO ( @-@h ) ( @ % higher vs. placebo , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the groups receiving losartan or captopril alone or the combination of angiotensin II + losartan no significant difference of Cmax EPO and AUCEPO ( @-@h ) compared to placebo could be detected .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows in a model of controlled , basic physiological stimulation of renal EPO production that angiotensin II is able to increase EPO levels in humans .
CONCLUSIONS	This effect of angiotensin II can be blocked by the specific AT@-receptor antagonist losartan but not by the ACE-inhibitor captopril .
CONCLUSIONS	The result may be interpreted as a hint that one signal for the control of EPO production in humans may be mediated by angiotensin II ( AT@ ) - receptors .

BACKGROUND	Adapalene is a new chemical entity with retinoid activity .
METHODS	@ p. @ adapalene gel ( Diffrine gel ) , @ p. @ adapalene gel and a commercially available @ p. @ tretinoin gel ( Aberel gel ) were compared in @ male and female patients with acne .
RESULTS	Inflammatory , non inflammatory , total lesion counts , and the global facial acne grade regularly decreased as a function of time in the three treatment groups .
RESULTS	No statistically or clinicaly significant differences were observed for these parameters between @ p. @ adapalene gel and @ p. @ tretinoin gel following a @-week treatment .
RESULTS	Conversely , both of these gels were significantly more effective than @ p. @ adapalene gel with regards to inflammatory and total lesion counts , and the global facial acne grade .
RESULTS	The differences of efficacy seen between both adapalene gels demonstrate a dose-dependent activity of the drug in the topical treatment of acne .
RESULTS	The three products induced retinoid-like skin irritation with significant differences in intensity in favour of adapalene for erythema , dryness , scaling and burning after application and in favour of tretinoin for persistent burning .
RESULTS	No treatment-related medical events were reported and adapalene plasma levels were lower than @ ng/ml ( limit of detection of the analytical method ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The topical treatment of acne with adapalene gels was found to be safe and effective , with a dose-related response .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy of @ p. @ adapalene gel and of @ p. @ tretinoin gel are not different but skin tolerance of @ p. @ adapalene gel is superior .

OBJECTIVE	This analysis of data from a randomized trial of chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer sought to determine whether a relationship exists between the presence and severity of the most commonly observed toxic effects and the corresponding quality of life ( QOL ) items .
METHODS	One hundred fifty-two eligible patients accrued from Canada by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group on a randomized trial of paclitaxel and cisplatin versus cyclophosphamide/cisplatin were included in the analysis .
METHODS	Toxicity to the chemotherapeutic treatments was subjectively evaluated using a trial-specific checklist for ovarian cancer and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C@ +@ questionnaire .
METHODS	Assessments were conducted at baseline , before each cycle of treatment ( @ weeks ) , and at each @-month follow-up during the next @ years ( or until progression ) .
RESULTS	The most frequently observed symptoms experienced during or shortly following chemotherapy were neurosensory loss , lethargy , nausea , vomiting , and alopecia .
RESULTS	Regression analyses revealed that change scores of QOL items related to motor weakness and gastrointestinal pain were common predictors for the change global QOL score during protocol treatment ; and change scores of QOL items related to lethargy or fatigue and change toxicity grade of mood predicted the change global QOL score after patients were off treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C@ +@ and trial-specific checklist was able to assess the effect of expected toxicities on patient ' s QOL during and following treatment , and so may be useful in addressing the concerns regarding methodological issues that have limited the acquisition of prospective , longitudinal treatment-related toxicity data .

BACKGROUND	Although biphasic defibrillation waveforms appear to be superior to monophasic waveforms in terminating VF , their relative benefits in out-of-hospital resuscitation are incompletely understood .
BACKGROUND	Prior comparisons of defibrillation waveform efficacy in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) are confined to patients presenting in a shockable rhythm and resuscitated by first responder ( basic life support ) .
BACKGROUND	This effectiveness study compared monophasic and biphasic defibrillation waveform for conversion of ventricular arrhythmias in all OHCA treated with advance life support ( ALS ) .
RESULTS	This prospective randomized controlled trial compared the rectilinear biphasic ( RLB ) waveform with the monophasic damped sine ( MDS ) waveform , using step-up energy levels .
RESULTS	The study enrolled OHCA patients requiring at least one shock delivered by ALS providers , regardless of initial presenting rhythm .
RESULTS	Shock success was defined as conversion at @s to organized rhythm after one to three escalating shocks .
RESULTS	We report efficacy results for the cohort of patients treated by ALS paramedics who presented with an initially shockable rhythm who had not received a shock from a first responder ( MDS : n = @ ; RLB : n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Shock success within the first three ascending energy shocks for RLB ( @ , @ , @J ) was superior to MDS ( @ , @ , @J ) for patients initially presenting in a shockable rhythm ( @ % versus @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	First shock conversion was @ % and@ % , for RLB and MDS , respectively ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in return of spontaneous circulation ( @ % versus @ % ) , survival to @h ( @ % versus @ % ) , and survival to discharge ( @ % versus @ % ) .
RESULTS	Mean @h survival rates of bystander witnessed events showed differences between waveforms in the early circulatory phase at @-@ min post event ( mean ( S.D. ) RLB @ ( @ ) versus MDS @ ( @ ) , p = @ ) and demonstrated decline as time to first shock increased to @ min .
CONCLUSIONS	Shock success to an organized rhythm comparing step-up protocol for energy settings demonstrated the RLB waveform was superior to MDS in ALS treatment of OHCA .
CONCLUSIONS	Survival rates for both waveforms are consistent with current theories on the circulatory and metabolic phases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .

OBJECTIVE	The present research tested whether an evaluative conditioning intervention makes thin-ideal models less enviable as standards for appearance-based social comparisons ( Study @ ) , and increases body satisfaction ( Study @ ) .
METHODS	Female participants were randomly assigned to intervention versus control conditions in both studies ( ns = @ and @ ) .
METHODS	Intervention participants learned to associate thin-ideal models with synonyms of fake whereas control participants completed an equivalent task that did not involve learning this association .
METHODS	The dependent variable in Study @ was an implicit measure of idealization of slim models assessed via a modified Implicit Association Test ( IAT ) .
METHODS	Study @ used a validated , self-report measure of body satisfaction as the outcome variable .
RESULTS	Intervention participants showed significantly less implicit idealization of slim models on the IAT compared to controls ( Study @ ) .
RESULTS	In Study @ , participants who undertook the intervention exhibited an increase in body satisfaction scores whereas no such increase was observed for control participants .
CONCLUSIONS	The present research indicates that it is possible to overcome the characteristic impact of thin-ideal models on women 's judgments of their bodies .
CONCLUSIONS	An evaluative conditioning intervention made it less likely that slim models were perceived as targets to be emulated , and enhanced body satisfaction .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of four different floss types for interproximal plaque removal on the normal dentition .
METHODS	@ dental hygiene students tested each of four different floss types : waxed , unwaxed , woven and shred-resistant .
METHODS	At baseline , all subjects received a prophylaxis to become plaque-free and identical flossing instructions were given .
METHODS	Subjects were then instructed not to brush , floss , or rinse for @ days to allow for plaque development .
METHODS	On the fourth day , each subject 's teeth were disclosed and scored using O'Leary 's Plaque Index .
METHODS	Subjects were then randomly assigned one of the four floss types to use throughout the dentition , following which a second plaque record was assessed .
METHODS	Subjects were timed while flossing , and then completed a @ cm Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) scoring their degree of discomfort/comfort and ease of use for each specific type of floss .
METHODS	This protocol was followed until all four floss types were tested by each subject .
METHODS	Results analyzed reductions in total interproximal plaque score ( TIPS ) , anterior ( teeth ) interproximal plaque score ( AIPS ) , and posterior ( teeth ) interproximal plaque score ( PIPS ) .

OBJECTIVE	To study the biological effects of nebulized insulin , administered intrapulmonary , to healthy volunteers .
METHODS	A double-blind , randomized , controlled intervention study .
METHODS	The department of Internal Medicine , University Hospital , Linkping , Sweden .
METHODS	Eight healthy , non-smoking volunteers , with a mean age of @ ( range @ to @ ) years .
METHODS	Regular human insulin @ U mL-@ ( Actrapid ) or @ % saline was given randomly as an oral inhalation .
METHODS	Insulin was given in three different doses ( @ , @ and @ U ) .
METHODS	Aerosol was generated by a new jet nebulizer .
METHODS	Blood glucose , serum insulin , and serum C-peptide .
RESULTS	After the @ U insulin dose the blood glucose concentration ( mean + / - SE ) fell from @ + / - @ to @ + / - @ mmol L-@ ( P < @ ) , concomitant with an increase in mean serum insulin concentrations , rising from @ + / - @ to @ + / - @ mU L-@ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum C-peptide concentrations simultaneously decreased from @ + / - @ to @ + / - @ mmol L-@ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	All changes were dose dependent .
RESULTS	No adverse reactions were noted and no significant changes in lung function tests .
CONCLUSIONS	Intrapulmonary insulin administration to healthy subjects can induce a significant hypoglycaemia and cause a clinically relevant increase in serum insulin concentrations .
CONCLUSIONS	If similar results can be obtained when administering insulin to diabetic subjects , this insulin administration route can be a future complement to certain groups of patients .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether the use of patient-controlled analgesia vs intramuscular injections improves postoperative psychological parameters , particularly anxiety .
METHODS	Randomized , controlled trial of patient-controlled analgesia vs as-needed intramuscular morphine with pre - and postoperative assessments of pain , mental status , narcotic use , anxiety and mood states .
METHODS	General surgical wards and surgical intensive care unit at a Veterans Administration hospital .
METHODS	Eighty-three elderly , chronically ill males undergoing major elective surgery .
METHODS	Subjects randomized to receive postoperative patient-controlled analgesia vs as-needed intramuscular morphine .
METHODS	Pre - and postoperative assessments of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , McGill-Dartmouth Part IV and Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire .
METHODS	Pain ( using linear analog scale ) , sedation score and narcotic use assessed every @ hours for @ hours .
RESULTS	No differences were found in state anxiety or self-perceived mood states .
RESULTS	Postoperative state anxiety was found to relate most closely to preoperative anxiety and postoperative complications , rather than method of analgesia or severity of pain .
RESULTS	However , patient-controlled analgesia subjects had significantly improved analgesia and increased satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of patient-controlled analgesia does not significantly alter the measured psychological parameters , compared with intramuscular injections .
CONCLUSIONS	Improved analgesia is the result of pharmacologic effects , independent of psychological factors .

OBJECTIVE	This study examined the associations of pretreatment and posttreatment depressive symptoms with drinking outcomes in the year following treatment in Project MATCH ( Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity ) , a multisite clinical trial of behavioral treatments for alcohol-use disorders .
METHODS	Data from @,@ participants were modeled using generalized estimating equations to examine drinking frequency and intensity , as reflected by percentage days abstinent ( PDA ) and average drinks per drinking day ( DDD ) .
METHODS	We predicted that patients who reported more pretreatment and posttreatment depressive symptoms would report greater drinking frequency ( PDA ) and more intense drinking ( DDD ) across the @-month follow-up period .
RESULTS	Pretreatment Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) scores predicted more frequent and intense drinking in the year following treatment , although not after accounting for posttreatment BDI scores , which were associated with the drinking outcomes as hypothesized .
RESULTS	Patients who reported more depressive symptoms in the year following treatment reported less abstinence ( PDA ) and more intense drinking ( DDD ) than patients with fewer posttreatment depressive symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings underscore the importance of obtaining repeated assessments of depression during the course of substance use treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , the data suggest the potential utility of augmenting standard chemical dependency care with depression-focused interventions for alcohol-dependent patients whose depressive symptoms do not subside during treatment .

BACKGROUND	Previous results of the EORTC intergroup trial @ showed that perioperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX@ ( folinic acid , fluorouracil , and oxaliplatin ) increases progression-free survival ( PFS ) compared with surgery alone for patients with initially resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer .
BACKGROUND	Here we present overall survival data after long-term follow-up .
METHODS	This randomised , controlled , parallel-group , phase @ study recruited patients from @ hospitals across Europe , Australia , and Hong Kong .
METHODS	Eligible patients aged @-@ years who had histologically proven colorectal cancer and up to four liver metastases were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to either perioperative FOLFOX@ or surgery alone .
METHODS	Perioperative FOLFOX@ consisted of six @-day cycles of oxaliplatin @mg/m ( @ ) , folinic acid @ mg/m ( @ ) ( DL form ) or @ mg/m ( @ ) ( L form ) on days @-@ plus bolus , and fluorouracil @ mg/m ( @ ) ( bolus ) and @ mg/m ( @ ) ( continuous @ h infusion ) , before and after surgery .
METHODS	Patients were centrally randomised by minimisation , adjusting for centre and risk score and previous adjuvant chemotherapy to primary surgery for colorectal cancer , and the trial was open label .
METHODS	Analysis of overall survival was by intention to treat in all randomly assigned patients .
RESULTS	Between Oct @ , @ , and July @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group ( @ patients in each group , of which @ per group were eligible and @ per group underwent resection ) .
RESULTS	At a median follow-up of @ years ( IQR @-@ ) , @ ( @ % ) patients in the perioperative chemotherapy group had died versus @ ( @ % ) in the surgery-only group ( HR @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In all randomly assigned patients , median overall survival was @ months ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the perioperative chemotherapy group and @ months ( @-@ ) in the surgery alone group .
RESULTS	@-year overall survival was @ % ( @ % CI @-@ ) in the perioperative chemotherapy group versus @ % ( @-@ ) in the surgery-only group .
RESULTS	Two patients in the perioperative chemotherapy group and three in the surgery-only group died from complications of protocol surgery , and one patient in the perioperative chemotherapy group died possibly as a result of toxicity of protocol treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	We found no difference in overall survival with the addition of perioperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX@ compared with surgery alone for patients with resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the previously observed benefit in PFS means that perioperative chemotherapy with FOLFOX@ should remain the reference treatment for this population of patients .

BACKGROUND	The bispectral index ( BIS ) and spectral entropy enable monitoring the depth of anaesthesia .
BACKGROUND	Mild hypothermia has been shown to affect the ability of electroencephalography monitors to reflect the anaesthetic drug effect .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of hypothermia during a cardio-pulmonary bypass on the correlation and agreement between the BIS and entropy variables compared with normothermic conditions .
METHODS	This prospective clinical study included coronary artery bypass grafting patients ( n = @ ) evaluating correlation and agreement ( Bland-Altman analysis ) between the BIS and both spectral and response entropy during a hypothermic cardio-pulmonary bypass ( @-@ degrees C ) compared with nomothermic conditions ( @-@ @ degrees C ) .
METHODS	Anaesthesia was maintained with propofol and sufentanil and adjusted clinically , while the anaesthetist was blinded to the monitors .
RESULTS	The BIS and entropy values decreased during cooling ( P < @ ) , but the decrease was more pronounced for entropy variables compared with BIS ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The correlation coefficients ( bias + / - SD ; percentage error ) between the BIS vs. spectral state entropy and response entropy were r ( @ ) = @ ( @ + / -@ ; @ % ) and r ( @ ) = @ ( -@ + / -@ ; @ % ) under normothermic conditions , and r ( @ ) = @ ( @ + / -@ ; @ % ) and r ( @ ) = @ ( @ + / -@ ; @ % ) under hypothermic conditions , respectively .
RESULTS	Bias was significantly increased under hypothermic conditions ( P < @ vs. normothermia ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Acceptable agreement was observed between the BIS and entropy variables under normothermic but not under hypothermic conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	The BIS and entropy variables may therefore not be interchangeable during a hypothermic cardio-pulmonary bypass .

BACKGROUND	Although the reduction in mortality with bivalirudin compared with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the Harmonizing Outcome with Revascularization and Stent in Acute Myocardial Infarction ( HORIZONS-AMI ) trial has been attributed to lower rates of major bleeding , alternative mechanisms have not been investigated in depth .
BACKGROUND	We sought to investigate whether there might be an interaction between white blood cell ( WBC ) count and bivalirudin for the risk of mortality , and whether this interaction is independent of major bleeding .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients enrolled in the HORIZONS-AMI trial , WBC count was available in @ ( @ % ) patients .
RESULTS	Patients were stratified according to WBC tertiles .
RESULTS	At @-year follow-up , bivalirudin was associated with significantly lower rates of mortality and cardiac mortality compared with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients in the upper WBC tertile ( all-cause death : @ % versus @ % , respectively ; P = @ ; cardiac death : @ % versus @ % ; respectively ; P < @ ) but not in patients in the mid-WBC or lower WBC tertiles .
RESULTS	The reduction of mortality with bivalirudin across WBC tertiles was independent of major bleeding , and a significant interaction was apparent for @-year all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality between WBC and bivalirudin therapy .
RESULTS	Similar findings were apparent at @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction , a significant interaction between bivalirudin therapy and admission WBC count was apparent for @-year mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	The reduction in mortality was independent of major bleeding , suggesting that other mechanisms may be implicated in the survival benefit observed with bivalirudin .

BACKGROUND	Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is the most common complication following coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) .
BACKGROUND	The mechanism of AF after CABG is not well defined ; however , it is suggested that endogenous adenosine , released in response to tissue hypoxia , may play a mechanistic role in these arrhythmias .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to examine whether intravenous theophylline , via adenosine A@ receptor antagonism , would correct or modify new-onset early ( < @ h post CABG ) atrial fibrillation in patients post CABG , and thereby implicate endogenous adenosine as an inciting agent .
METHODS	A prospective double-blind , placebo-controlled study design was applied to @ consecutive patients with coronary artery disease who had undergone CABG .
METHODS	Any patient who developed AF within @ h of the operative procedure was randomly assigned to receive @ mg/kg of intravenous theophylline ( Group A ) or matched intravenous placebo ( Group B ) .
METHODS	The patients who converted to sinus rhythm within @ min of drug administration were accepted as showing positive responses .
RESULTS	Thirty patients comprised the study group .
RESULTS	In Group A , @ of the @ patients ( @ % ) converted from AF to sinus rhythm within @ min of theophylline administration .
RESULTS	One patient who converted to sinus rhythm @ min after theophylline administration was accepted as showing a negative response .
RESULTS	In the placebo-treated group , no patient converted to sinus rhythm within @ min ( p < @ compared with Group A ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The mechanism of AF after CABG is not well defined and is probably multifactorial .
CONCLUSIONS	However , this study demonstrated that antagonism of the adenosine A@ receptor can promptly convert many of these patients back to sinus rhythm , and thereby implicates endogenously released adenosine in a mechanistic role for inciting early ( < @ h ) post-CABG AF .

OBJECTIVE	This prospective , randomized , double-blind multicenter trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a single bolus injection of the novel modified tissue-type plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) E@ in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction compared with that of native t-PA .
BACKGROUND	E@ is a novel modified t-PA with a prolonged half-life ( t@/@ alpha > or = @ min ) compared with native t-PA ( t@/@ alpha = @ min ) .
BACKGROUND	E@ can be administered in patients as a single intravenous bolus injection , and early recanalization can be expected .
METHODS	The efficacy of E@ was compared with that of native t-PA in @ patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated within @ h of onset in a prospective , randomized , double-blind multicenter trial .
METHODS	Patients were given either @ mg/kg body weight of E@ intravenously over @ min or native t-PA ( tisokinase ) @ mg or @ million IU ( @ % of the total dose over @ to @ min , the remainder infused over @ min ) .
RESULTS	The primary end point was the recanalization rate of the infarct-related coronary artery at @ min after the start of treatment .
RESULTS	Time to reperfusion was shorter in the E@ group than in the native t-PA group .
RESULTS	Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow grade @ or @ recanalization at @ , @ , @ and @ min after administration was observed in @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] @ % to @ % ) of the E@-treated patients and in @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) of native t-PA-treated patients , respectively ( p = @ at @ min ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study indicates that , compared with native t-PA , a single bolus injection of E@ over @ min produces a higher rate of early recanalization of the infarct-related coronary artery without fatal bleeding complications .

BACKGROUND	Persons with Parkinson disease ( PD ) exhibit decreased muscular fitness including decreased muscle mass , muscle strength , bioenergetic capabilities and increased fatigability .
OBJECTIVE	This purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the therapeutic effects of resistance training with and without creatine supplementation in patients with mild to moderate PD .
METHODS	Twenty patients with idiopathic PD were randomized to receive creatine monohydrate supplementation plus resistance training ( CRE ) or placebo ( lactose monohydrate ) plus resistance training ( PLA ) , using a double-blind procedure .
METHODS	Creatine and placebo supplementation consisted of @ g/d for the first @ days and @ g/d thereafter .
METHODS	Both groups participated in progressive resistance training ( @ sessions , @ times per week , @ set of @-@ repetitions , @ exercises ) .
METHODS	Participants performed @-repetition maximum ( @-RM ) for chest press , leg extension , and biceps curl .
METHODS	Muscular endurance was evaluated for chest press and leg extension as the number of repetitions to failure using @ % of baseline @-RM .
METHODS	Functional performance was evaluated as the time to perform @ consecutive chair rises .
RESULTS	Statistical analyses ( ANOVA ) revealed significant Group x Time interactions for chest press strength and biceps curl strength , and post hoc testing revealed that the improvement was significantly greater for CRE .
RESULTS	Chair rise performance significantly improved only for CRE ( @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both PLA and CRE significantly improved @-RM for leg extension ( PLA : @ % ; CRE : @ % ) .
RESULTS	Muscular endurance improved significantly for both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings demonstrate that creatine supplementation can enhance the benefits of resistance training in patients with PD .

OBJECTIVE	Treatments for the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia are urgently needed .
OBJECTIVE	We developed and tested a @-week , group-based , manualized , compensatory cognitive training intervention targeting prospective memory , attention , learning/memory , and executive functioning .
OBJECTIVE	The intervention focused on compensatory strategies , such as calendar use , self-talk , note taking , and a @-step problem-solving method , and did not require computers .
METHODS	In a randomized controlled trial , @ outpatients with DSM-IV primary psychotic disorders were assigned to receive standard pharmacotherapy alone or compensatory cognitive training + standard pharmacotherapy for @ weeks .
METHODS	Assessments of neuropsychological performance and functional capacity ( primary outcomes ) and psychiatric symptom severity , quality of life , social skills performance , cognitive insight , and self-reported everyday functioning ( secondary outcomes ) were administered at baseline , posttreatment , and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Data were collected between September @ and August @ .
RESULTS	Hierarchical linear modeling analyses demonstrated significant compensatory cognitive training-associated effects on attention at follow-up ( P = @ ) , verbal memory at posttreatment and follow-up ( P values @ ) , and functional capacity ( University of California , San Diego Performance-based Skills Assessment ) at follow-up ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The compensatory cognitive training group also differentially improved in negative symptom severity at posttreatment and follow-up ( P values @ ) and subjective quality of life at follow-up ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Compensatory cognitive training , a low-tech , brief intervention , has the potential to improve not only cognitive performance but also functional skills , negative symptoms , and self-rated quality of life in people with psychosis .

BACKGROUND	The effects of anesthetics on inflammation and oxidative parameters , evaluated in patients without comorbidities undergoing minor surgery , remain unknown .
BACKGROUND	The present study aimed to investigate the inflammatory and oxidative stress status in adult patients undergoing elective minimally invasive surgery , using different anesthetic techniques .
METHODS	Thirty patients classified as ASA physical status I , who were scheduled for minor surgeries ( tympanoplasty or septoplasty ) , were randomly allocated into two groups : balanced ( BAL ) anesthesia maintained with isoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) with propofol .
METHODS	Blood samples were drawn prior to the induction of anesthesia ( baseline ) , @ min after the beginning of anesthesia and one day after surgery .
METHODS	The proinflammatory cytokine IL-@ was determined by flow cytometry ; DNA oxidation was evaluated by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay , and plasma malondialdehyde ( lipid peroxidation biomarker ) and antioxidant status were determined through fluorometry .
RESULTS	Increased IL-@ was observed one day after surgery in both groups ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Malondialdehyde levels did not change among the time points assessed or between the groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Whereas BAL anesthesia had no effect on acid nucleic and antioxidant status , TIVA decreased oxidized/alkylated purines ( P = @ ) and increased antioxidant status ( P = @ ) during anesthesia .
RESULTS	The two groups did not differ significantly in DNA oxidation or antioxidant status ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BAL anesthesia maintained with isoflurane and TIVA maintained with propofol are safe by virtue of not causing oxidative stress status in ASA physical status I patients undergoing minimally invasive surgeries .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , even in minor surgeries , TIVA with propofol produces an antioxidant effect in patients .

OBJECTIVE	Is Strain-Counterstrain treatment combined with exercise therapy more effective than exercise alone in reducing levels of pain and disability in people with acute low back pain ?
METHODS	Randomised trial with concealed allocation , assessor blinding , and intention-to-treat analysis .
METHODS	@ ( @ female ) participants between @ and @ years experiencing acute low back pain were randomised to experimental ( n = @ ) and control ( n = @ ) groups .
METHODS	Participants attended four treatments in two weeks .
METHODS	The experimental group received Strain-Counterstrain treatment and review of standardised exercises ( abdominal bracing , knee to chest , and lumbar rotation ) .
METHODS	The control group performed the standardised exercises under supervision .
METHODS	Following the intervention period , all participants received exercise progression , manual therapy , and advice .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the modified Oswestry low back pain disability questionnaire , measured at @ weeks ( ie , end of treatment ) , @ weeks , and @ weeks .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included the SF-@ , visual analogue scale pain ratings , and a @-point global rating of change .
RESULTS	The experimental intervention was not more effective than exercise alone in reducing levels of pain and disability .
RESULTS	Mean between-group differences in change from baseline for the Oswestry Disability Index were @ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) after treatment , -@ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) at @ weeks , and @ ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) at @ weeks .
RESULTS	Other outcomes did not differ significantly between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no advantage in providing Strain - Counterstrain treatment to patients with acute low back pain , although further studies could examine whether a subset of these patients can benefit from the treatment .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to determine whether chronic or acute impairment of flow mediated vasodilation ( FMD ) in the brachial artery of smokers can be restored or preserved by the antioxidant vitamin E.
BACKGROUND	Transient impairment of endothelial function after heavy cigarette smoking and chronic endothelial dysfunction in smokers result at least in part from increased oxidative stress .
METHODS	We studied @ healthy male smokers ( mean + / - SD , @ + / - @ cigarettes per day ) randomly assigned to receive either @ IU vitamin E per day ( n = @ , age @ + / - @ years ) or placebo ( n = @ , age @ + / - @ years ) for four weeks and @ age-matched healthy male nonsmokers .
METHODS	Flow mediated vasodilation and endothelium-independent , nitroglycerin-induced dilation were assessed in the brachial artery using high resolution ultrasound ( @ MHz ) at baseline and after therapy .
METHODS	Subjects stopped smoking @ h before the ultrasound examinations .
METHODS	At the end of the treatment period , a third scan was obtained @ min after smoking a cigarette ( @ mg nicotine , @ mg tar ) to estimate transient impairment of FMD .
RESULTS	Flow mediated vasodilation at baseline was abnormal in the vitamin E ( @ + / - @ , p < @ ) and in the placebo group ( @ + / - @ , p < @ ) compared with nonsmoking controls ( @ + / - @ ) .
RESULTS	Using a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to examine the effects of vitamin E on FMD , we found no effect for the grouping factor ( p = @ ) in the ANOVA over time but a highly significant difference with respect to time ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The interaction of the time factor and the grouping factor also proved to be significant ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Flow mediated vasodilation values remained similar after treatment for four weeks in both groups but declined faster after smoking a cigarette in subjects taking placebo compared with those receiving vitamin E ( p values from successive differences for the time/group factor : @ / @ ) .
RESULTS	The transient attenuation of FMD ( calculated as the percent change in FMD ) was related to the improvement of the antioxidant status , estimated as percent changes in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances ( r = -@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Nitroglycerin-induced dilation did not differ between study groups at baseline or after therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	These results demonstrate that oral supplementation of vitamin E can attenuate transient impairment of endothelial function after heavy smoking due to an improvement of the oxidative status but can not restore chronic endothelial dysfunction within four weeks in healthy male smokers .

BACKGROUND	There is no established pharmacological treatment for the core symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) .
BACKGROUND	Galantamine hydrobromide , an acetyl cholesterone inhibitor , has pharmacological properties that might benefit patients with CFS .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and tolerability of galantamine hydrobromide in patients with CFS .
METHODS	Randomized , double-blind trial conducted June @ through July @ at @ outpatient centers in the United Kingdom ( n = @ ) , United States ( n = @ ) , the Netherlands ( n = @ ) , Sweden ( n = @ ) , and Belgium ( n = @ ) involving @ patients with a clinical diagnosis of CFS ( modified US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients were randomly assigned to receive @ mg of galantamine hydrobromide ; @ patients , @ mg ; @ patients , @ mg ; and @ patients , @ mg ( these patients received medicine in the tablet form @ times per day ) ; a total of @ patients received matching placebo tablets @ times per day .
METHODS	The primary efficacy variable was the global change on the Clinician Global Impression Scale after @ , @ , @ , and @ weeks of treatment .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were changes in core symptoms of CFS on the Chalder Fatigue Rating Scale , the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire , and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ; changes in quality of life on the Nottingham Health Profile ; and assessment of plasma-free cortisol levels and cognitive performance on a computer-based battery of tests .
RESULTS	After @ weeks , there were no statistically significant differences between any of the galantamine or placebo groups in clinical condition on the Clinician Global Impression Scale , or for any of the secondary end points .
RESULTS	Exploratory regression analysis failed to detect any consistent prognostic factor that might have influenced the primary or any secondary outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial did not demonstrate any benefit of galantamine over placebo in the treatment of patients with CFS .

BACKGROUND	Dexamethasone ( DEXA ) is commonly used to reduce brain swelling during neurosurgical procedures .
BACKGROUND	DEXA , however , has many side-effects that can increase the risks of post-operative complications .
BACKGROUND	In contrast , progesterone ( PRO ) has fewer side-effects and has been found to be neuroprotective on traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
BACKGROUND	Whether PRO may be used as an alternative to DEXA during routine procedures has not been fully explored .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of DEXA and PRO on surgical brain injury ( SBI ) .
METHODS	Seventy-five adult male Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into five groups : ( @ ) SBI + drug vehicle ( peanut oil , @ml kg ( -@ ) ) ; ( @ ) SBI + DEXA ( @mg kg ( -@ ) ) ; ( @ ) SBI + low-dose PRO ( @mg kg ( -@ ) ) ; ( @ ) SBI + high-dose PRO ( @mg kg ( -@ ) ) ; and ( @ ) sham SBI + drug vehicle .
METHODS	Magnetic resonance imaging study and assessments of brain water content ( BWC ) , blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) permeability , cellular inflammatory responses and matrix metalloproteinase @ ( MMP-@ ) expression were conducted .
RESULTS	This model consistently resulted in increased BWC and BBB disruption .
RESULTS	PRO reduced astrocyte and microglia responses and attenuated brain oedema with preservation of BBB .
RESULTS	A significant down-regulation of MMP-@ expression occurred in the PRO @ group .
CONCLUSIONS	PRO is as effective as DEXA in reducing brain oedema and inflammation following SBI ; @mg kg ( -@ ) of PRO was demonstrated to be more effective in relieving acute cellular inflammatory responses .

OBJECTIVE	Propofol is associated with pain on injection .
OBJECTIVE	It is common practice to premix lidocaine with propofol prior to injection .
OBJECTIVE	Lipuro propofol , a propofol emulsified in medium - and long-chain triglycerides , has been shown to reduce the intensity of injection pain compared to Diprivan , although a number of studies report no reduction in overall incidence of pain .
METHODS	We conducted this randomized double-blind trial to determine the extent of further pain reduction by adding lidocaine to Lipuro propofol .
METHODS	A total of @ ASA I-III patients were randomized to one of four groups to receive Diprivan propofol ( Group DP ) , Lipuro propofol ( Group LP ) , Diprivan with lidocaine ( Group DL ) and Lipuro propofol with lidocaine ( Group LL ) .
METHODS	The drug mixture was administered at a constant rate of @ mL h ( -@ ) via a @-G cannula into a dorsal hand vein .
METHODS	Pain was assessed during induction and upon patient recovery , using a @-point visual analogue scale .
RESULTS	Both the incidence and severity of pain were found to be significantly lower with addition of lidocaine to Lipuro propofol ( P < @ ) compared to Lipuro alone , Diprivan with or without the addition of lidocaine .
CONCLUSIONS	Lidocaine added to Lipuro propofol makes induction of anaesthesia less painful compared to Lipuro propofol alone or Diprivan with lidocaine .

OBJECTIVE	We sought to assess the efficacy of vascular brachytherapy ( VBT ) combined with stenting for the primary prevention of restenosis .
BACKGROUND	Intravascular brachytherapy after stent implantation for de novo lesions has been abandoned for the present .
BACKGROUND	We revisited this procedure by optimizing all procedural steps-the use of glycoprotein IIb/IIa blockers , direct stenting , adequate radiation coverage , avoidance of edge damage , source centering , intravascular ultrasound-guided dosimetry , and continuation of a dual anti-platelet regimen for one year .
METHODS	The Beta-Radiation Investigation with Direct stenting and Galileo in Europe ( BRIDGE ) study is a multicenter , randomized controlled trial evaluating the long-term efficacy of VBT with P-@ ( @ Gy at @ mm in the coronary wall ) after direct stenting .
METHODS	The primary end point was angiographic intra-stent late loss ; secondary end points were six months binary restenosis and neo-intimal hyperplasia .
METHODS	Patients ( n = @ ) with de novo lesions ( @ to @ mm in diameter up to @ mm long ) were randomized to either VBT or no-VBT .
RESULTS	At six months , intra-stent loss was @ and @ mm ( p < @ ) in the irradiated and control groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Intra-stent neo-intimal volume was reduced from @ mm@ to @ mm@ .
RESULTS	However , in the irradiated group there were six late occlusions as well as eight restenoses outside the stented and peri-stented area at the fall-off dose edges of the irradiated area .
RESULTS	Accordingly , the target vessel revascularization and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rates at one year in the VBT group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) were higher than in the control group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the optimization of pre - , peri - , and post-procedural factors and despite the relative efficacy of the brachytherapy for the prevention of the intra-stent neo-intimal hyperplasia , the clinical outcome of the irradiated group was less favorable than that of the control group .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to examine the selegiline treatment compared to methylphenidate ( MPH ) in children and adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) .
METHODS	Forty subjects , aged @-@ years , boys and girls , who were diagnosed as having ADHD , using the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) , were randomly assigned to receive either selegiline or MPH for @ days .
METHODS	Treatment outcomes were assessed using the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Scale ( ADHS ) administered at baseline and on days @ , @ , @ , and @ following the commencement of treatment .
METHODS	Side effects were also rated .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between sex , age , weight , and ethnicity of participants in the @ groups .
RESULTS	Both groups showed a significant improvement over the @ days of treatment resulting from the teachers ' and parents ' ADHS scores across the treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Following the trial , MPH did not effect greater mean improvement as a result of the parents ' or teachers ' ADHS scores than selegiline .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , selegiline appears to be effective and well tolerated for ADHD in children and adolescents .

BACKGROUND	Subarachnoid blockade with local anesthetics induces respiratory depression .
BACKGROUND	Although the addition of fentanyl to bupivacaine has become popular in subarachnoid blockade for Cesarean section , there is no information on the effect of intrathecal fentanyl on maternal spirometric respiratory function in parturients undergoing Cesarean section .
METHODS	We tested the effect of the addition of intrathecal fentanyl to hyperbaric bupivacaine on maternal spirometric performance in @ consenting parturients undergoing Cesarean section .
METHODS	The parturients were randomized into two groups : those receiving @ ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine @ % and @ ml of saline intrathecally and those receiving @ ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine and @ ml of fentanyl ( @ microg ) intrathecally .
METHODS	We performed spirometry on arriving at the operation room and @ min after subarachnoid blockade .
RESULTS	Subarachnoid blockade with bupivacaine significantly decreased the peak expiratory flow rate , but did not induce significant changes in vital capacity and forced vital capacity .
RESULTS	The addition of intrathecal fentanyl to bupivacaine improved the quality of subarachnoid blockade , but did not lead to a deterioration in respiratory function compared with intrathecal bupivacaine alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of intrathecal fentanyl to hyperbaric bupivacaine did not lead to a deterioration in maternal spirometric respiratory function in parturients undergoing Cesarean section .

OBJECTIVE	The dynamics uf viral decline following the initiation of antiretroviral treatment were studied in @ HIV-@-infected patients participating in a two-arm trial comparing immediate ( group A : ritonavir , zidovudine and lamivudine ) and delayed ( group B : ritonavir supplemented by zidovudine and lamivudine on day @ ) triple therapy .
OBJECTIVE	Parameters underlying viral dynamics were estimated using mathematical models tailored to these treatment protocols .
RESULTS	The decline in plasma HIV-@ density between day @ and @ was steeper in group A ( -@ + / - @ log@ ) than group B ( -@ + / -@ log@ ) .
RESULTS	In a subset of patients amenable to full mathematical analysis , a short-lived productively infected cell compartment ( producing approximately @ % of total virions ) decayed with a half-life of @-@ @ days , whereas a long-lived infected cell compartment decayed with a half-life of @-@ @ days .
RESULTS	Estimates for the time for the elimination of virus from these two cell populations ranged from @ to @ days .
RESULTS	The rate of loss of productively infected CD@ + T cells was positively correlated with baseline viral load in group A and in the combined dataset .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that HIV-infected cell populations may have a faster turnover in patients with higher viral loads due to higher infection rate parameters , higher rates of virus production , or lower virus clearance rates .

BACKGROUND	Rivaroxaban ( BAY @-@ ) -- an oral , direct Factor Xa inhibitor -- could be an alternative to heparins and warfarin for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders .
RESULTS	This randomized , double-blind , double-dummy , active-comparator-controlled , multinational , dose-ranging study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily rivaroxaban relative to enoxaparin for prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement .
RESULTS	Patients ( n = @ ) were randomized to once-daily oral rivaroxaban doses of @ , @ , @ , @ , or @ mg ( initiated @ to @ hours after surgery ) or a once-daily subcutaneous enoxaparin dose of @ mg ( given the evening before and > or = @ hours after surgery ) .
RESULTS	Study drugs were continued for an additional @ to @ days ; mandatory bilateral venography was performed the following day .
RESULTS	The primary end point ( composite of any deep vein thrombosis , objectively confirmed pulmonary embolism , and all-cause mortality ) was observed in @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % , and @ % of patients receiving @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ mg rivaroxaban , and @ mg enoxaparin , respectively ( n = @ , per-protocol population ) .
RESULTS	No significant dose-response relationship was found for efficacy ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Major postoperative bleeding was observed in @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % , @ % , and @ % of patients receiving @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ mg rivaroxaban , and @ mg enoxaparin , respectively ( n = @ , safety population ) , representing a significant dose-response relationship ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Rivaroxaban showed efficacy and safety similar to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total hip replacement , with the convenience of once-daily oral dosing and without the need for coagulation monitoring .
CONCLUSIONS	When both efficacy and safety are considered , these results suggest that @ mg rivaroxaban once daily should be investigated in phase III studies .

BACKGROUND	The myometrial hyperactivity and reduced uterine blood flow of primary dysmenorrhea is to a large extent caused by increased vasopressin secretion .
BACKGROUND	A new therapeutic approach for this condition is to develop antagonists of uterine vasopressin V@a receptors .
BACKGROUND	We studied a test model of vasopressin-induced dysmenorrhea in healthy , sterilized women and compared responses against those in dysmenorrheic subjects .
METHODS	Eight women with primary dysmenorrhea and eight sterilized , healthy women participated in recordings of intrauterine pressure and experienced pain on days @-@ of two menstruations .
METHODS	We tried to identify biochemical markers in plasma of uterine ischemia .
METHODS	Furthermore , the effects of repeated bolus injections of @ pmol/kg b w of vasopressin or placebo on these parameters were assessed .
RESULTS	The vasopressin injections caused statistically significant increases in the area under the intrauterine pressure curve ( AUC ) in both healthy volunteers and patients with dysmenorrhea , the overall responses being greater in healthy volunteers .
RESULTS	The experienced pain measured by visual analog scale in individual dysmenorrheic subjects tended to show higher maximal post-dose scores for the vasopressin injections than for placebo .
RESULTS	Maximum visual analog scale scores and maximum AUCs in individual subjects tended to be related .
RESULTS	Mean creatine kinase MB levels were higher in women with dysmenorrhea than in healthy subjects both before and after vasopressin administration , the converse being observed for C-reactive protein levels .
CONCLUSIONS	The present model appears to be useful for evaluating new drugs for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea .

BACKGROUND	@,@-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) misuse is associated with hyponatremia particularly in women .
BACKGROUND	Hyponatremia is possibly due to inappropriate secretion of plasma arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) .
OBJECTIVE	To assess whether MDMA increases plasma AVP and copeptin in healthy male and female subjects and whether effects depend on MDMA-induced release of serotonin and norepinephrine .
OBJECTIVE	Copeptin , the C-terminal part of the AVP precursor preprovasopressin , is cosecreted with AVP and can be determined more reliably .
METHODS	We used a randomized placebo-controlled crossover design .
METHODS	Plasma and urine osmolalities as well as AVP and copeptin levels were measured in @ healthy subjects ( eight female , eight male ) at baseline and after MDMA ( @ mg ) administration .
METHODS	In addition , we tested whether effects of MDMA on AVP and copeptin secretion can be prevented by pretreatment with the serotonin and norepinephrine transporter inhibitor duloxetine ( @ mg ) , which blocks MDMA-induced transporter-mediated release of serotonin and norepinephrine .
RESULTS	MDMA significantly elevated plasma copeptin levels at @ min and at @ min compared with placebo in women but not in men .
RESULTS	The copeptin response to MDMA in women was prevented by duloxetine .
RESULTS	MDMA also nonsignificantly increased plasma AVP levels in women , and the effect was prevented by duloxetine .
RESULTS	Although subjects drank more water after MDMA compared with placebo administration , MDMA tended to increase urine sodium levels and urine osmolality compared with placebo , indicating increased renal water retention .
CONCLUSIONS	MDMA increased plasma copeptin , a marker for AVP secretion , in women but not in men .
CONCLUSIONS	This sex difference in MDMA-induced AVP secretion may explain why hyponatremia is typically reported in female ecstasy users .
CONCLUSIONS	The copeptin response to MDMA is likely mediated via MDMA-induced release of serotonin and/or norepinephrine because it was prevented by duloxetine , which blocks the interaction of MDMA with the serotonergic and noradrenergic system .

BACKGROUND	This study reports the effect of providing Norwegian school children with free fruit or vegetables every school day and the effect of an existing fee-based School Fruit Programme .
METHODS	Seventh grade pupils and their parents completed questionnaires at baseline ( autumn @ ) and at follow-up ( spring @ ) .
METHODS	Nine schools participated in the School Fruit Programme for free ( Free fruit ) , nine schools took part at standard conditions ( Paid fruit ) , and @ schools did not take part in the subscription programme ( No fruit ) .
METHODS	A total of @ @th graders ( @ or @ years old at baseline ) participated both at baseline and at follow-up .
RESULTS	At follow-up , pupils attending the Free fruit schools had significantly higher intake of fruit and vegetables at school than the pupils at the Paid fruit and No fruit schools ( P < @ , mean intakes were @ , @ and @ portions , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Subscribers at the Paid fruit schools had significantly higher intake than the non-subscribers at the same schools .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing a free piece of fruit or a vegetable is an effective strategy to increase school children 's fruit and vegetable intake .
CONCLUSIONS	The existing School Fruit Programme appears to increase the intake among the subscribers , but thereby also tends to increase an existing difference in consumption patterns among subscribers and non-subscribers .

BACKGROUND	Maternal , Newborn , and Child Health ( MNCH ) household survey data are collected mainly with pen-and-paper .
BACKGROUND	Smartphone data collection may have advantages over pen-and-paper , but little evidence exists on how they compare .
OBJECTIVE	To compare smartphone data collection versus the use of pen-and-paper for infant feeding practices of the MNCH household survey .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the two data collection methods for differences in data quality ( data recording , data entry , open-ended answers , and interrater reliability ) , time consumption , costs , interviewers ' perceptions , and problems encountered .
METHODS	We recruited mothers of infants aged @ to @ months in four village clinics in Zhaozhou Township , Zhao County , Hebei Province , China .
METHODS	We randomly assigned mothers to a smartphone or a pen-and-paper questionnaire group .
METHODS	A pair of interviewers simultaneously questioned mothers on infant feeding practices , each using the same method ( either smartphone or pen-and-paper ) .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ mothers , and all completed the study .
RESULTS	Data recording errors were prevented in the smartphone questionnaire .
RESULTS	In the @ pen-and-paper questionnaires ( @ mothers ) , we found @ data recording errors in @ questionnaires .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in recording variation between the groups for the questionnaire pairs ( P = @ ) or variables ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The smartphone questionnaires were automatically uploaded and no data entry errors occurred .
RESULTS	We found that even after double data entry of the pen-and-paper questionnaires , @ % ( @/@ ) of the questionnaires did not match and needed to be checked .
RESULTS	The mean duration of an interview was @ ( SD @ ) minutes for the smartphone method and @ ( SD @ ) minutes for the pen-and-paper method , which was not significantly different between the methods ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean costs per questionnaire were higher for the smartphone questionnaire ( @ , equal to US $ @ at the exchange rate on April @ , @ ) than for the pen-and-paper questionnaire ( @ , equal to US $ @ ) .
RESULTS	The smartphone method was acceptable to interviewers , and after a pilot test we encountered only minor problems ( eg , the system halted for a few seconds or it shut off ) , which did not result in data loss .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study showing that smartphones can be successfully used for household data collection on infant feeding in rural China .
CONCLUSIONS	Using smartphones for data collection , compared with pen-and-paper , eliminated data recording and entry errors , had similar interrater reliability , and took an equal amount of time per interview .
CONCLUSIONS	While the costs for the smartphone method were higher than the pen-and-paper method in our small-scale survey , the costs for both methods would be similar for a large-scale survey .
CONCLUSIONS	Smartphone data collection should be further evaluated for other surveys and on a larger scale to deliver maximum benefits in China and elsewhere .

BACKGROUND	Second-generation antipsychotics ( SGAs ) differ from first-generation antipsychotics ( FGAs ) with respect to induction of less extrapyramidal morbidity , partially reducing negative symptoms , and causing modest improvement in neurocognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia .
BACKGROUND	SGAs demonstrate @-HT@a antagonism .
BACKGROUND	Differential effects of SGAs and FGAs on cortical gray volumes are explored herein .
METHODS	Cerebral cortical gray was examined volumetrically in @ patients with schizophrenia before and following @ days of treatment with two SGAs ( risperidone and ziprasidone ; n = @ ) or a FGA ( haloperidol ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Seven ( untreated ) control subjects were also assessed at a similar interval .
RESULTS	During treatment with the SGAs risperidone and ziprasidone , cerebral cortical gray of @ patients with schizophrenia expanded @ + / - @ cc ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Six patients receiving the FGA haloperidol , as well as @ control subjects , showed no change in cortical gray volumes ( p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) at the time of reassessment .
CONCLUSIONS	Volumetric increase of cerebral cortical gray occurred early in the course of treatment with the SGAs ziprasidone and risperidone , but not with the FGA haloperidol .
CONCLUSIONS	Such cortical gray expansion may be relevant to the reported enhanced neurocognition and quality of life associated with SGA treatment .

BACKGROUND	Levonorgestrel ( LNG ) consistently prevents follicular rupture only when it is given before the onset of the ovulatory stimulus .
BACKGROUND	As locally synthesized prostaglandin ( PG ) plays a crucial role in follicular rupture and cyclooxygenase-@ ( cox-@ ) catalyses the final step of PG synthesis , we reasoned that adding a cox-@ inhibitor to LNG would prevent follicular rupture even after the ovulatory process had been triggered by the gonadotrophin surge .
METHODS	Forty-one women were divided into two groups .
METHODS	One was treated when the size of the leading follicle was @-@ mm ( n = @ ) and the other when it was > or = @ mm ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Each woman contributed with one cycle treated with LNG @ mg single dose plus placebo and another treated with LNG + meloxicam ( Melox ) @ mg , in a randomized order .
METHODS	Serial blood sampling for the assay of LH and follicular monitoring by transvaginal ultrasound were performed before and after treatment .
RESULTS	Follicular rupture failed to occur within the @-day period that followed treatment in @ and @ % of cycles treated with LNG + Placebo and LNG + Melox , respectively , in the @-@ mm group ( P = @ ) and in @ and @ % of cycles treated with LNG + Placebo and LNG + Melox , respectively , in the > or = @ mm group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The overall proportion of cycles with no follicular rupture or ovulatory dysfunction increased significantly by the addition of Melox to LNG ( @ versus @ % , P < @ ; n = @-matched pairs ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The trend towards increased incidence of no follicular rupture when Melox was combined with LNG suggests that the addition of a cox-@ inhibitor has the potential to improve the contraceptive efficacy of LNG by a pre-fertilization effect .

OBJECTIVE	Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of slow-release oral morphine ( SROM ) compared with methadone for detoxification from methadone and SROM maintenance treatment .
METHODS	Randomized , double-blind , double-dummy , comparative multi-centre study with parallel groups .
METHODS	Three psychiatric hospitals in Austria specializing in in-patient detoxification .
METHODS	Male and female opioid dependents ( age > @ years ) willing to undergo detoxification from maintenance therapy in order to reach abstinence .
METHODS	Abstinence was reached from maintenance treatment by tapered dose reduction of either SROM or methadone over a period of @ days .
METHODS	Efficacy analyses were based on the number of patients per treatment group completing the study , as well as on the control of signs and symptoms of withdrawal [ measured using Short Opioid Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) ] and suppression of opiate craving .
METHODS	In addition , self-reported somatic and psychic symptoms ( measured using Symptom Checklist SCL-@-R ) were monitored .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients enrolled into the study , @ were eligible for analysis ( SROM : n = @ , methadone : n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Completion rates were @ % in the SROM group and @ % in the methadone group [ difference between groups : @ % ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : -@ % to @ % ] .
RESULTS	The rate of discontinuation in the study was high mainly because of patients voluntarily withdrawing from treatment .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences between treatment groups were found in terms of signs and symptoms of opiate withdrawal , craving for opiates or self-reported symptoms .
RESULTS	SROM and methadone were both well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Detoxification from maintenance treatment with tapered dose reduction of SROM is non-inferior to methadone .

###14729792
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of nicorandil ( a hybrid ATP sensitive potassium channel ( K + ( ATP ) channel ) opener/nitric oxide donor ) with those of isosorbide dinitrate ( ISDN ) on myocardial microcirculation and cardiac function in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) who had undergone reperfusion treatment by direct balloon angioplasty .
METHODS	Double blind randomised study .
METHODS	@ patients with AMI in Killip class I.
METHODS	Patients were assigned into two treatment groups : a nicorandil group ( n = @ ) and an ISDN group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Each drug was infused intravenously at @ mg/h for @ hours starting at admission and was administered directly to the treated coronary artery immediately after angioplasty .
RESULTS	Compared with ISDN , nicorandil more frequently caused recovery of ST segment elevation just after reperfusion ( @ of @ ( @ % ) in the nicorandil group v @ of @ ( @ % ) in the ISDN group , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The nicorandil group had higher values of averaged peak velocity @ minutes after reperfusion ( mean ( SD ) @ ( @ ) cm/s v @ ( @ ) cm/s , p = @ ) and higher values of regional wall motion of the infarcted area three weeks after onset of AMI ( -@ ( @ ) v -@ ( @ ) SD/chord , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A combination of nicorandil drip infusion starting before reperfusion and intracoronary injection immediately after reperfusion is more effective than a similarly performed infusion of ISDN in preserving myocardial microcirculation in the reperfused AMI area .
CONCLUSIONS	The nicorandil regimen resulted in better left ventricular regional wall motion .

BACKGROUND	Direct laryngoscopy along with manual inline stabilization ( MIS ) is currently the standard care for patients with suspected neck injuries .
BACKGROUND	However , cervical collar immobilization is more commonly performed in the prehospital environment , and its early removal is necessary before intubation .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that if usability of Airway Scope ( AWS ) in a difficult airway could also bring merits to intubation under cervical collar immobilization , unnecessary risk caused by the removal of a neck collar may be prevented .
METHODS	In this crossover study , @ consenting patients presenting for surgery were assigned to undergo intubation using AWS .
METHODS	Neck was stabilized manually and by a neck collar in a random order before laryngoscopy was performed by the same anesthesiologist .
METHODS	Measurements include interincisor distance ( IID ) , success rate , intubation time , and fluoroscopic examination of the upper and middle cervical spine .
RESULTS	IID was notably narrower after application of a neck collar ( mean SE : MIS , @ mm @ mm ; collar , @ mm @ mm ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	One and @ failures were encountered in MIS and collar groups , respectively ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Intubation time proved no statistical significance .
RESULTS	Extension of craniocervical junction was observed in both groups , but occipitoatlantal joint was significantly more extended in collar group ( median [ range ] : AWS , @-degree angle [ -@ to @-degree angle ] ; collar , @-degree angle [ @ to @-degree angle ] ; p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	AWS laryngoscopy under cervical collar immobilization fails to meet our expectation .
CONCLUSIONS	Intubation failed in @ % of the cases in collar group whereas only @ % of the cases in MIS group .
CONCLUSIONS	Significant difference of mouth opening limitation is probably the major reason , as @ of @ failed cases in collar group had IID < @ mm .
CONCLUSIONS	This was insufficient to insert the @-mm blade of AWS .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , occipitoatlantal joint suffered a greater extension when wearing a neck collar .
CONCLUSIONS	Differences in the method to stabilize the neck may be the reason .
CONCLUSIONS	When compared with cervical collar immobilization , AWS laryngoscopy along with MIS seems to be a safer and more definite method to secure airway of neck-injured trauma patients because it limits less mouth opening and upper cervical spine movement .

BACKGROUND	Alendronate sodium ( Fosamax , Merck , Sharp & Dohme , Whitehouse Station , NJ , USA ) is an aminobisphosphonate that can inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption activity to reduce bone turnover rate and improve progressive gains in bone mass .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study comparing the effects on bone turnover markers between daily treatment with alendronate sodium @ mg and placebo .
METHODS	Forty early postmenopausal women completed three months of treatment .
METHODS	The bone turnover rate was determined by measuring the biochemical markers at baseline , week @ and at the end of the three-month treatment period .
METHODS	All adverse events were recorded during each follow-up visit .
RESULTS	Patients receiving alendronate treatment had a significant decrease in urinary excretion of the bone resorption marker deoxypyridinoline ( Dpd ) as well as one of the bone formation markers , bone-specific alkaline phosphatase ( AlkP-B ) .
RESULTS	Patients receiving placebo tended to have increased urinary excretion of bone resorption and formation markers .
RESULTS	At the end of three months , the mean percentage change of Dpd and AlkP-B from baseline in the group receiving @ mg alendronate was @ % and @ % reduction , respectively .
RESULTS	The placebo group had @ % and @ % increase , respectively .
RESULTS	Overall , three biochemical markers ( Dpd , AlkP-B and osteocalcin ) differed significantly between the treatment and control groups after three months of treatment .
RESULTS	The drug was well tolerated , without a significant increase in incidence of adverse effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and esophageal irritation .
CONCLUSIONS	Bone turnover rate decreased quickly following drug administration .
CONCLUSIONS	The incidence of adverse effects did not differ significantly between the alendronate and placebo groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Alendronate is , therefore , recommended as an effective nonhormonal treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis .

BACKGROUND	Atacicept is a soluble , fully human , recombinant fusion protein that inhibits B cell-stimulating factors APRIL ( a proliferation-inducing ligand ) and BLyS ( B-lymphocyte stimulator ) .
BACKGROUND	The APRIL - LN study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with active lupus nephritis ( LN ) , receiving newly initiated corticosteroids ( CS ) and mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) .
METHODS	This was a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase II/III , @-week study .
METHODS	At screening ( Day -@ ) , patients initiated high-dose CS ( the lesser of @ mg/kg/day or @ mg/day prednisone ) and MMF ( @ g daily , increased by @ g/day each week to @ g daily ) .
METHODS	From Day @ , atacicept ( @ mg , subcutaneously , twice weekly for @ weeks , then weekly ) was initiated with MMF along with a tapered dose of CS .
RESULTS	The trial was terminated after the enrollment of six patients , due to an unexpected decline in serum immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) and the occurrence of serious infections .
RESULTS	Efficacy was thus not evaluated .
RESULTS	By Day @ , serum IgG levels had declined substantially in patients then randomized to atacicept ( n = @ ) compared with placebo ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients receiving atacicept also had more severe proteinuria on Day -@ than those on placebo .
RESULTS	Lymphocyte counts were low at screening in all patients .
RESULTS	IgG decline continued following initiation ( Day @ ) of atacicept .
RESULTS	Three atacicept-treated patients developed serum IgG below the protocol-defined discontinuation threshold of @ g/l , two of whom developed serious pneumonia .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies are needed to characterize the safety , efficacy , and pharmacodynamic response of atacicept in LN patients .

OBJECTIVE	To compare three different methods of teaching CPR to parents of infants at high risk for sudden cardiopulmonary arrest and to identify characteristics that predict difficulty in learning CPR .
METHODS	We conducted a prospective , multicenter clinical trial of @ parents and other infant caretakers .
METHODS	Subjects were randomly assigned to @ of @ CPR training protocols : an instructor-taught CPR class , an instructor-taught CPR class followed by a social support intervention , or a self-training video module .
METHODS	CPR proficiency was evaluated with the use of a CPR skills checklist .
RESULTS	Of @ subjects , @ ( @ % ) were able to demonstrate successful CPR after training .
RESULTS	Univariate analysis revealed that unsuccessful learners were likely to be less educated , to have lower incomes , to never have attended a previous CPR class , and to have better psychosocial adjustment to their infant 's illness , compared with successful learners .
RESULTS	The proportion of successful learners was significantly higher in the @ instructor-taught classes than in the self-training video class .
RESULTS	Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to develop a predictive profile to describe unsuccessful learners .
RESULTS	The following characteristics independently predicted unsuccessful learners : CPR learned in the self-training video group , fewer years of education , and better psychosocial adjustment .
CONCLUSIONS	Most parents of infants at high risk for sudden death can demonstrate successful CPR skills at the completion of @ class .
CONCLUSIONS	However , a significant minority will require extra attention to be successful .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-training video instruction may not be an adequate substitute for instructor-taught CPR .

METHODS	Prospective , randomized , crossover design .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effectiveness of the Johnson & Johnson Back Plaster , the ABC Warme-Pflaster , and the ThermaCare HeatWrap on skin and paraspinal muscle temperature .
OBJECTIVE	Also , to compare the subjects ' heat perception for the @ products .
BACKGROUND	Heat therapy is a common treatment for low back pain and disability .
BACKGROUND	There are a number of products on the market that are suggested to relieve low back pain by providing warmth to the back ; however , their effectiveness for increasing tissue temperature compared with heat sensation has not been tested .
METHODS	To measure paraspinal muscle temperature , @ thermocouple monofilament was inserted into the paraspinal muscle @ cm from the skin surface at the L@ level using a @-gauge @-in ( @-cm ) sterile catheter .
METHODS	To measure skin interface temperature , @ thermocouples were placed on the skin at distances of @ cm and @ cm from the insertion site .
METHODS	The Isothermex was used to record temperatures to the nearest @ degrees C for @ minutes .
METHODS	The subjects also rated heat perception using a @-cm visual analog scale at @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ minutes .
METHODS	Analysis of covariance models were used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	There was a significant product x time interaction ( F@ ,@ = @ , P < @ ) at the intramuscular site , but there was not a significant product x time interaction ( F@ ,@ = @ , P = @ ) at the skin site .
RESULTS	Both the main effects for product ( F@ ,@ = @ , P < @ ) and time ( F@ ,@ = @ , P < @ ) were significant for the visual analog scale data .
RESULTS	The ThermaCare HeatWrap produced significant increases in both skin and intramuscular temperatures with less heat sensation .
RESULTS	The Johnson & Johnson Back Plaster and the ABC Warme-Pflaster increased temperature at the skin surface and provided the greatest heat sensations , but they did not provide intramuscular heat .
CONCLUSIONS	The ThermaCare HeatWrap is more effective at increasing temperature at a @-cm depth with less perceived heat compared to the Johnson & Johnson Back Plaster and the ABC Warme-Pflaster .
CONCLUSIONS	The latter @ products provide a sensation of heat but do not actually provide a muscle temperature change at a depth of @ cm .

BACKGROUND	Secretory phospholipase A ( @ ) ( sPLA ( @ ) ) may play a role in myonecrosis after elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) .
BACKGROUND	Inhibition of this enzyme may have a beneficial effect .
BACKGROUND	The central hypothesis of this study was that treatment with varespladib , a small-molecule inhibitor of sPLA ( @ ) would reduce postprocedural release of cardiac biomarkers after elective percutaneous coronary intervention .
RESULTS	Between October @ and June @ , @ stable patients were randomized in a phase II trial to receive varespladib @ mg PO BID or placebo @ to @ days before and for @ days after elective percutaneous coronary intervention .
RESULTS	The primary end point was elevation of troponin I or creatine kinase-MB above the upper limit of normal at @ to @ or @ to @ hours after percutaneous coronary intervention .
RESULTS	Mean age was @ and @ years , with @ % and @ % with diabetes mellitus and @ % and @ % with prior myocardial infarction for the varespladib and placebo groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The primary end point occurred in @ % of varespladib and @ % of placebo patients ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Troponin I @ times the upper limit of normal was observed in @ % and @ % ( P = @ ) and creatine kinase-MB @ times the upper limit of normal in @ % and @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median ( first and third quartiles ) change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein in these @ groups was @ mg/L ( -@ and @ ) and @ mg/L ( @ and @ ) at @ to @ hours ( P = @ ) and @ mg/L ( -@ and @ ) and @ mg/L ( -@ and @ ) at @ to @ days ( P = @ ) , whereas change in sPLA ( @ ) activity at @ to @ days in a subset was -@ ng/ml ( -@ and -@ ) and @ ng/ml ( -@ and @ ) ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Inhibition of sPLA ( @ ) by varespladib administered for @ to @ days before the procedure does not reduce periprocedural myonecrosis associated with elective percutaneous coronary intervention .

OBJECTIVE	To establish whether or not the serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) sertraline can improve arousal and alertness of patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and associated diffuse axonal injury ( DAI ) .
OBJECTIVE	Serotonin is a major inhibitory as well an excitatory neurotransmitter , and serotonergic neurons modulate the activity of brain regions responsible for motor control , arousal , attention , and emotional regulation .
METHODS	Tertiary care inpatient rehabilitation centre directly attached to a university hospital level-one trauma centre .
METHODS	Prospective placebo-controlled randomized trial utilizing sertraline on admission to acute rehabilitation .
METHODS	Eleven subjects , post-high speed motor vehicle crash and post-severe TBI ( GCS < or = @ ) with presumed DAI randomized to receive either sertraline @mg per day or placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	All subjects were within @ weeks of acute injury .
METHODS	Outcome measures recorded were the Orientation Log ( daily ) , Agitated Behaviour Scale ( daily ) , and the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test ( weekly ) .
RESULTS	Both placebo and active medication groups demonstrated similar rates of improvement on all three scales .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the rates of recovery for either study group ( p > @ , ANOVA with repeated measures ) .
RESULTS	The groups did not demonstrate a statistically significant negative effect on recovery either , although the size is too small for a statistically reliable beta-effect .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study fails to establish whether the early use of sertraline may improve alertness , decrease agitation or improve cognitive recall of material .
CONCLUSIONS	This may be due to the small size of the study group , the brief duration of treatment or by a skewed placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger studies will be required to prove any efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	There were no complications with its use and sertraline did not demonstrate a detrimental effect on recovery .
CONCLUSIONS	This indicates that sertraline may be safe to use in the treatment of psychiatric or behavioural complications attributable to TBI .

BACKGROUND	Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO@ therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH .
BACKGROUND	We intended to assess the safety and efficacy of high-dose MgSO@ therapy after SAH as means to prevent DIND and to evaluate the impact on clinical outcome .
METHODS	This was a prospective , randomized , single-blind , placebo-controlled study .
METHODS	The MgSO@ infusion was adjusted every @ hours until day @ according to the target serum Mg@ + level .
METHODS	The occurrence of DIND , secondary infarction , side effects , and the outcome after @ and @ months were assessed .
RESULTS	Fifty-eight patients were randomized ; @ received placebo and @ MgSO@ .
RESULTS	The difference in occurrence of DIND and secondary infarction was not significant .
RESULTS	The intention-to-treat analysis revealed a trend toward better outcome ( P = @ ) after @ months .
RESULTS	On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after @ months ( P = @ ) and a trend toward better outcome after @ year ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly more often hypotension ( P = @ ) and hypocalcemia ( P = @ ) occurred as side effects in the treatment group .
RESULTS	In @ patients ( @ % ) , the MgSO@ therapy had to be stopped before day @ because of side effects .
RESULTS	No predictive factor leading to termination was found in a postrandomization analysis .
CONCLUSIONS	High-dose MgSO@ therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , because of the high frequency of the side effects , patients should be observed in an intensive or intermediate care setting .

OBJECTIVE	Teduglutide , a GLP-@ analogue , may restore intestinal structural and functional integrity by promoting repair and growth of the mucosa and reducing gastric emptying and secretion , thereby increasing fluid and nutrient absorption in patients with short bowel syndrome ( SBS ) .
OBJECTIVE	This @-week placebo-controlled study evaluated the ability of teduglutide to reduce parenteral support in patients with SBS with intestinal failure .
METHODS	In @ patients randomised to receive subcutaneous teduglutide @ mg/kg/day ( n = @ ) , @ mg/kg/day ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) once daily , parenteral fluids were reduced at @-week intervals if intestinal fluid absorption ( @ h urine volumes ) increased @ % .
METHODS	Responders were subjects who demonstrated reductions of @ % in parenteral volumes from baseline at weeks @ and @ .
METHODS	The primary efficacy end point , a graded response score ( GRS ) , took into account higher levels and earlier onset of response , leading to longer duration of response .
METHODS	The intensity of the response was defined as a reduction from baseline in parenteral volume ( from @ % to @ % ) , and the duration of the response was considered the response at weeks @ , @ and @ .
METHODS	The results were tested according to a step-down procedure starting with the @ mg/kg/day dose .
RESULTS	Using the GRS criteria , teduglutide in a dose of @ mg/kg/day did not have a statistically significant effect compared with placebo ( @/@ vs @/@ , p = @ ) , while teduglutide in a dose of @ mg/kg/day had a significant effect ( @/@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Since parenteral volume reductions were equal ( @ @ and @ @ ml/day ) , the trend towards higher baseline parenteral volume ( @ @ vs @ @ ml/day , p = @ ) in the @ mg/kg/day group compared with the @ mg/kg/day group may have accounted for this discrepancy .
RESULTS	Three teduglutide-treated patients were completely weaned off parenteral support .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events were distributed similarly between active treatment groups and placebo .
RESULTS	Villus height , plasma citrulline concentration and lean body mass were significantly increased with teduglutide compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Teduglutide was safe , well tolerated , intestinotrophic and suggested pro-absorptive effects facilitating reductions in parenteral support in patients with SBS with intestinal failure .
CONCLUSIONS	ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	High-dose interferon ( IFN ) for @ year ( HDI ) is the US Food and Drug Administration-approved adjuvant therapy for patients with high-risk melanoma .
OBJECTIVE	Efforts to modify IFN dose and schedule have not improved efficacy .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether a shorter course of biochemotherapy would be more effective .
METHODS	S@ ( S@ : Chemotherapy Plus Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With Melanoma ) was an Intergroup phase III trial that enrolled high-risk patients ( stage IIIA-N@a through IIIC-N@ ) , randomly assigning them to receive either HDI or biochemotherapy consisting of dacarbazine , cisplatin , vinblastine , interleukin-@ , IFN alfa-@b ( IFN -- @b ) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor given every @ days for three cycles .
METHODS	Coprimary end points were relapse-free survival ( RFS ) and overall survival ( OS ) .
RESULTS	In all , @ patients were enrolled .
RESULTS	Grade @ and @ adverse events occurred in @ % and @ % of HDI patients and @ % and @ % of biochemotherapy patients , respectively .
RESULTS	At a median follow-up of @ years , biochemotherapy improved RFS ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) , with a median RFS of @ years ( @ % CI , @ years to not reached [ NR ] ) versus @ years for HDI ( @ % CI , @ to @ years ) and a @-year RFS of @ % versus @ % .
RESULTS	Median OS was not different ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) , with a median OS of @ years ( @ % CI , @ years to NR ) for biochemotherapy versus @ years ( @ % CI , @ years to NR ) for HDI and a @-year OS of @ % for both arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Biochemotherapy is a shorter , alternative adjuvant treatment for patients with high-risk melanoma that provides statistically significant improvement in RFS but no difference in OS and more toxicity compared with HDI .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate a least squares fitting technique for the purpose of measuring total respiratory compliance ( Crs ) and resistance ( Rrs ) in patients submitted to partial ventilatory support , without the need for esophageal pressure measurement .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized study .
METHODS	A general ICU of a University Hospital .
METHODS	@ patients in acute respiratory failure , intubated and assisted by pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) .
METHODS	Patients were ventilated at @ different levels of pressure support .
METHODS	At the end of the study , they were paralyzed for diagnostic reasons and submitted to volume controlled ventilation ( CMV ) .
RESULTS	A least squares fitting ( LSF ) method was applied to measure Crs and Rrs at different levels of pressure support as well as in CMV .
RESULTS	Crs and Rrs calculated by the LSF method were compared to reference values which were obtained in PSV by measurement of esophageal pressure , and in CMV by the application of the constant flow , end-inspiratory occlusion method .
RESULTS	Inspiratory activity was measured by P@ @ .
RESULTS	In CMV , Crs and Rrs measured by the LSF method are close to quasistatic compliance ( -@ + / - @ ml/cmH@O ) and to the mean value of minimum and maximum end-inspiratory resistance ( +@ + / - @ cmH@O / ( l/s ) ) .
RESULTS	Applied during PSV , the LSF method leads to gross underestimation of Rrs ( -@ + / - @ cmH@O / ( l/s ) ) and overestimation of Crs ( +@ + / - @ ml/cmH@O ) whenever the set pressure support level is low and the activity of the respiratory muscles is high ( P@ @ was @ + / - @ cmH@O ) .
RESULTS	However , satisfactory estimations of Crs and Rrs by the LSF method were obtained at increased pressure support levels , resulting in a mean error of -@ + / - @ ml/cmH@O and -@ + / - @ cmH@O / ( l/s ) , respectively .
RESULTS	This condition was coincident with a P@ @ of @ + / - @ cmH@O .
CONCLUSIONS	The LSF method allows non-invasive evaluation of respiratory mechanics during PSV , provided that a near-relaxation condition is obtained by means of an adequately increased pressure support level .
CONCLUSIONS	The measurement of P@ @ may be helpful for titrating the pressure support in order to obtain the condition of near-relaxation .

BACKGROUND	Inhaled corticosteroids are widely used in the treatment of persistent asthma , usually combined with inhaled beta@-agonists .
BACKGROUND	Previous research suggests that short-acting beta@-agonists ( SABAs ) may downregulate the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled corticosteroids , thereby increasing asthma morbidity .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether @-bromotyrosine and @,@-dibromotyrosine levels , specific markers of eosinophil activation , reflect treatment effects on airway inflammation of inhaled corticosteroids and SABAs and support previous conclusions .
METHODS	Levels of @-bromotyrosine and @,@-dibromotyrosine were measured in sputum supernatants using stable isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in a randomized , placebo-controlled , crossover study of treatment with terbutaline , budesonide , and their combination in patients with persistent asthma .
METHODS	Thirty-four individuals were randomized , and @ completed the study .
RESULTS	Treatment with budesonide lowered median @-bromotyrosine levels compared with treatment with placebo , terbutaline , and budesonide-terbutaline ( @ vs @ , @ , and @ @-bromotyosine/tyrosine [ mmol/mol ] ; P < @ ) and lowered median @,@-dibromotyrosine levels compared with placebo and terbutaline treatments ( @ vs @ and @ @,@-dibromotyrosine / tyrosine [ mmol/mol ] , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Unlike eosinophil numbers , @-bromotyrosine and @,@-dibromotyrosine levels did not increase with terbutaline treatment compared with placebo treatment but were significantly raised when terbutaline was added to budesonide treatment .
RESULTS	@-Bromotyrosine levels correlated significantly with eosinophil cationic protein levels in all groups .
CONCLUSIONS	@-Bromotyrosine and @,@-dibromotyrosine levels reflect treatment effects in asthma and support previous findings that SABAs impair the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled corticosteroids .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition to eosinophil numbers and eosinophil cationic protein levels , these modified tyrosine residues provide useful information about the inflammatory state of the airways .

OBJECTIVE	Pulmonary rehabilitation programs often show beneficial effects in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
OBJECTIVE	These programs are usually hospital-based .
OBJECTIVE	This study assesses the feasibility and application of a @-week Home-Care Rehabilitation Program ( HCRP ) , carried out by general practitioners , physiotherapists , and home-care nurses .
METHODS	Effects of the HCRP are assessed in @ COPD patients with moderate to severe airflow limitation ( inspiratory vital capacity [ IVC ] : mean , @ [ SD , @ ] percent predicted , mean FEV@ : @ [ @ ] percent predicted ) and are compared with a stratified and randomized control group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	All participating disciplines judged the program to be useful and feasible .
RESULTS	Patient compliance with the rehabilitation exercises was high .
RESULTS	No major problems concerning the rehabilitation program were reported .
RESULTS	After the HCRP , @-minute walking distance improved significantly from @ m [ @ ] to @ m [ @ ] and maximal work load ( W max ) , as measured during an incremental cycle test , increased from @ W [ @ ] to @ W [ @ ] .
RESULTS	At equal work levels ( W submax ) during the cycle test both Borg dyspnea and leg effort scores decreased significantly after the HCRP ( @ [ @ ] versus @ [ @ ] and @ [ @ ] versus @ [ @ ] , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Changes in walking distance , dyspnea , and leg effort scores at W submax were significantly different between the two groups .
RESULTS	IVC and FEV@ did not change significantly .
RESULTS	In the control group , no significant changes in any parameter were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	It was possible to design and perform successfully a home-care rehabilitation program , providing both objective and subjective improvements in a group of patients with COPD .
CONCLUSIONS	A home-care rehabilitation program appears to be a valuable component in the management of COPD patients with a moderate to severe airflow limitation .

OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to test fractal dimension ( D ) , a measure of clustering of ventricular premature complexes ( VPCs ) , on entry Holter recording as a predictor of future arrhythmic death and other-cause mortality in postinfarction patients in the Cardiac Arrhythmic Suppression Trial ( CAST ) .
BACKGROUND	Nonlinear dynamic methods of signal processing are being applied in medicine to provide new insights into apparently `` chaotic '' biologic events , including cardiac arrhythmias .
BACKGROUND	One such application is the derivation of a fractal D to describe the clustering of VPCs in time .
METHODS	Baseline Holter recordings were analyzed in blinded manner for @ patients : @ died or had a resuscitated cardiac arrest during follow-up , and @ matched patients had no events .
METHODS	Fractal D , measured in four ways , was assessed as a predictor using Cox regression .
RESULTS	One measure of D ( high resolution D ) was a significant univariate ( relative hazard ratio @ per SD change , p = @ ) and multivariate ( hazard ratio @ , p = @ ) predictor of arrhythmic death but not other death ( univariate p = @ , relative hazard @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fractal D was greater ( VPCs less clustered ) in those patients free of arrhythmic events .
RESULTS	On subgroup analysis , the predictive value of D resided in the randomized patient group ( i.e. , those who showed VPC suppression during initial antiarrhythmic drug titration and were randomized to blinded therapy with active drug or placebo ) ( multivariate hazard ratio @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A high resolution fractal D was predictive of arrhythmic ( but not nonarrhythmic ) death in a large postinfarction cohort .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study of this new signal processing approach to ambulatory electrocardiographic recording will be of interest .

BACKGROUND	Minor myocardial damage after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) is associated with cardiac risks , which statins seem to reduce .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to examine whether intensive lipid-lowering therapy is more effective in decreasing the risk of cardiac injury after PCI than moderate lipid-lowering therapy .
RESULTS	Subjects comprised @ patients with stable angina without previous statin treatment , randomly assigned to either an intensive lipid-lowering group ( Group A : target low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) < @ mg/dl ) or a moderate lipid-lowering group ( Group B : target LDL-C < @ mg/dl ) @ weeks before PCI .
RESULTS	All patients took statins to reach target LDL-C levels .
RESULTS	Incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury was assessed by analyzing levels of creatine kinase myocardial isozyme ( CK-MB ) and cardiac troponin T ( TnT ) before and @ , @ and @ h after PCI .
RESULTS	Minor myocardial damage was defined as TnT elevation to > @ ng/ml .
RESULTS	Frequency of minor myocardial damage was @ % in Group A and @ % in Group B ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	CK-MB was above the upper limit of normal ( ULN ) in @ % of Group A and @ % of Group B ( p = @ ) , and CK-MB was > @x ULN in @ % of Group A and @ % of Group B ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intensive lipid-lowering therapy before PCI reduces minor myocardial damage during PCI with stenting compared with moderate lipid-lowering therapy .

BACKGROUND	The role of dopamine in cocaine abuse has been long recognized .
BACKGROUND	Cocaine use can profoundly alter dopaminergic functioning through depletion of this monoamine and changes in receptor functioning .
BACKGROUND	Based on these facts , levodopa ( L-dopa ) pharmacotherapy may be helpful in reducing or abolishing cocaine use .
OBJECTIVE	The current studies sought to evaluate the safety , tolerability and efficacy of L-dopa as a treatment for cocaine dependence .
METHODS	In Study @ , @ cocaine-dependent subjects were randomized in a @-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled safety trial .
METHODS	Subjects received either placebo , or @ mg L-dopa plus @ mg of the peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor , carbidopa , in a sustained-release preparation ( Sinemet CR ) .
METHODS	In Study @ , @ cocaine-dependent subjects were enrolled in a @-week , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to compare placebo to @/@ mg and @/@ mg L-dopa/carbidopa treatments .
METHODS	Placebo or L-dopa were administered twice daily in both studies .
RESULTS	L-dopa was well tolerated with similar retention and medication adherence rates compared to placebo .
RESULTS	Only two side effects occurred more often in L-dopa-treated patients : nausea and dizziness .
RESULTS	L-dopa lowered diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent fashion .
RESULTS	In these trials , L-dopa had no effect on cocaine use , cocaine craving , or mood .
CONCLUSIONS	These two studies demonstrate the safety and tolerability of L-dopa pharmacotherapy in cocaine-dependent patients .
CONCLUSIONS	No evidence for greater efficacy of L-dopa compared to placebo was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	The possibility of enhancing treatment effects by combining L-dopa with other behavioral or pharmacological interventions is discussed .

OBJECTIVE	Due to the gap in suicide-specific intervention training for mental health students and professionals , e-learning is one solution to improving provider skills in the Veterans Affairs ( VA ) health system .
OBJECTIVE	This study focused on the development and evaluation of an equivalent e-learning alternative to the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality ( CAMS ) in-person training approach at a Veteran Health Affairs medical center .
METHODS	The study used a multicenter , randomized , cluster , and three group design .
METHODS	the development of e-CAMS was an iterative process and included pilot testing .
METHODS	Eligible and consenting mental health providers , who completed a CAMS pre-survey , were randomized .
METHODS	Provider satisfaction was assessed using the standard VA evaluation of training consisting of @ items .
METHODS	Two post training focus groups , divided by learning conditions , were conducted to assess practice adoption using a protocol focused on experiences with training and delivery of CAMS .
RESULTS	A total of @ providers in five sites were randomized to three conditions : @ to e-learning , @ to in-person , @ to the control .
RESULTS	The providers were primarily female , Caucasian , midlife providers .
RESULTS	Based on frequency scores of satisfaction items , both learning groups rated the trainings positively .
RESULTS	In focus groups representing divided by learning conditions , participants described positive reactions to CAMS training and similar individual and institutional barriers to full implementation of CAMS .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first evaluation study of a suicide-specific e-learning training within the VA. .
CONCLUSIONS	The e-CAMS appears equivalent to the in-person CAMS in terms of provider satisfaction with training and practice adoption , consistent with other comparisons of training deliveries across specialty areas .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional evaluation of provider confidence and adoption and patient outcomes is in progress .
CONCLUSIONS	The e-CAMS has the potential to provide ongoing training for VA and military mental health providers and serve as a tutorial for psychiatrists in preparation for specialty boards .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the possible role played by endogenous dopamine as a modulator of renal sodium ( Na + ) reabsorption after a combined Na + and volume load .
METHODS	A randomized placebo-controlled study .
METHODS	Ten healthy volunteers and four hypertensive patients were subjected to intravenous infusions of @ @ % saline ( @ mmol Na + ) administered from @ to @ h after oral administration of placebo or of carbidopa , a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor .
RESULTS	Studies on control subjects after placebo showed that natriuresis occurred during the @ h after commencement of the saline infusion , with falls in plasma albumin concentration , plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration ; in comparison with results of mock infusion ( @ mmol Na + ) there was no change in the urinary excretion of dopamine and noradrenaline ( In their free or conjugated forms ) .
RESULTS	There was , however , a marked surge in excretion of urinary conjugated dopamine and in the dopamine : noradrenaline ratio from @ to @ h , after either type of infusion .
RESULTS	Administration of carbidopa before the saline infusion resulted in a marked decrease in excretion of urinary free dopamine , but had no effect on the surge in excretion of urinary conjugated dopamine .
RESULTS	Saline infusion decreased proximal fractional Na + reabsorption .
RESULTS	Administration of carbidopa delayed but did not prevent this decrease .
RESULTS	The effects of saline infusion and of carbidopa on the urinary excretion of dopamine and noradrenaline from hypertensive patients were similar to those observed with the healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings indicate that volume expansion by intravenous saline infusion has no appreciable effect on the urinary free dopamine excretion from normal or hypertensive humans ; with any apparent increase , it is important to exclude the possibility of conversion of conjugates to free dopamine in vitro .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , that carbidopa administration did not inhibit the afternoon surge of conjugated dopamine suggests that administration of carbidopa is deficient as a tool to investigate the functional role of the renal dopamine system .

METHODS	Adverse events ( AEs ) were assessed by site personnel at all clinic visits ( screening , first dose at week @ , and at weeks @ , @ , @ , @ , and follow-up ) .
METHODS	COPD exacerbations were defined as worsening respiratory status requiring a change in medication or an unscheduled provider visit .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients received study medication .
RESULTS	The demographic composition of all treatment arms was similar .
RESULTS	The mean age was @ years , @ % were men , and mean baseline forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV ( @ ) ) was @ L ( @ % predicted ) .
RESULTS	Mean improvement in trough FEV ( @ ) over @ weeks was significantly greater with all @ arformoterol doses ( @ microg BID , +@ % ; @ microg BID , +@ % ; @ microg QD , +@ % ) and for salmeterol ( +@ % ) relative to placebo ( +@ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were significantly greater improvements in the mean percentage change in FEV ( @ ) AUC ( @-@h ) from the predose value over @ weeks ( @ microg BID , @ % , @ microg BID , @ % , @ microg QD , @ % ; salmeterol , @ % ) versus placebo ( @ % ; P < or = @ ) ; all doses of arformoterol were statistically different from salmeterol for this end point ( P < or = @ ) .
RESULTS	At week @ , TDI focal scores were significantly greater with all arformoterol doses compared with placebo ( mean [ @ % CI ] : @ microg BID , @ [ @-@ @ ] ; @ microg BID , @ [ @-@ @ ] ; @ microg QD , @ [ @-@ @ ) , suggesting treatment-associated improvement in dyspnea , however , the difference between salmeterol and placebo was not statistically significant ( @ [ -@ to @ ] ) .
RESULTS	Improvements in health status , as measured using SGRQ total scores , were -@ to -@ U in the arformoterol groups , -@ U for salmeterol , and -@ U for placebo ; @ % CI of differences versus placebo suggested significant improvement for the arformoterol @ microg BID and salmeterol groups .
RESULTS	There was a similar frequency of AEs and COPD exacerbations across all groups , including placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	In this trial , patients with moderate to severe COPD administered nebulized arformoterol over @ weeks were observed to have significant and sustained improvements in airway function and dyspnea compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	The results also suggest that all doses of arformoterol , including the lowest dose ( @ microg BID ) , were effective .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , nebulized arformoterol was well tolerated .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of pharmacist management of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus in a community-based primary care group .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial of pharmacist management of diabetes compared with usual medical care .
METHODS	Patients @ years or older with glycosylated hemoglobin ( A@C ) levels of @ % or higher were enrolled .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( n = @ ) or a control group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Management in the control group included the use of registries and targeted patient outreach .
METHODS	The intervention group participated in the same outreach program plus medication management , patient education , and disease control by a pharmacist .
RESULTS	Nonparametric data showed median A@C decreases of @ % for the intervention group and @ % for the control group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients in the intervention group improved their A@C level by at least @ % relative to the control group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Most of this benefit was seen for patients of nonwhite race/ethnicity compared with control subjects ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Male patients showed significantly greater benefit as well , with a median A@C decrease of @ % vs @ % for controls ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with poorly controlled diabetes improved A@C levels significantly when pharmacist management was added to an aggressive organizational diabetes management program .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that clinically trained pharmacists can help primary care providers improve diabetes management , especially among male patients and among patients of nonwhite race/ethnicity .

BACKGROUND	The viral protease inhibitor ritonavir has the capacity to inhibit and induce the activity of cytochrome P@-@A ( CYP@A ) isoforms , leading to drug interactions that may influence the efficacy and toxicity of other antiretroviral therapies , as well as pharmacologic treatments of coincident or complicating diseases .
METHODS	The inhibitory effect of ritonavir on the biotransformation of the hypnotic agents triazolam and zolpidem was tested in vitro using human liver microsomes .
METHODS	In a double-blind clinical study , volunteer study subjects received @ mg triazolam or @ mg zolpidem concurrent with low-dose ritonavir ( four doses of @ mg ) , or with placebo .
RESULTS	Ritonavir was a potent in vitro inhibitor of triazolam hydroxylation but was less potent as an inhibitor of zolpidem hydroxylation .
RESULTS	In the clinical study , ritonavir reduced triazolam clearance to < @ % of control values ( p < @ ) , prolonged elimination half-life ( @ versus @ hours ; p < @ ) , and magnified benzodiazepine agonist effects such as sedation and performance impairment .
RESULTS	In contrast , ritonavir reduced zolpidem clearance to @ % of control values ( p < @ ) , and slightly prolonged elimination half-life ( @ versus @ hours ; NS ) .
RESULTS	Benzodiazepine agonist effects of zolpidem were not altered by ritonavir .
CONCLUSIONS	Short-term low-dose administration of ritonavir produces a large and significant impairment of triazolam clearance and enhancement of clinical effects .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , ritonavir produced small and clinically unimportant reductions in zolpidem clearance .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings are consistent with the complete dependence of triazolam clearance on CYP@A activity , compared with the partial dependence of zolpidem clearance on CYP@A .

BACKGROUND	Alcohol use disorder is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide .
BACKGROUND	Despite the availability of efficacious treatments , few individuals with an alcohol use disorder are actively engaged in treatment .
BACKGROUND	Available evidence suggests that primary care may play a crucial role in the identification of patients with an alcohol use disorder , delivery of interventions , and the success of treatment .
OBJECTIVE	The principal aims of this study were to test the effectiveness of a primary care-based Alcohol Care Management ( ACM ) program for alcohol use disorder and treatment engagement in veterans .
METHODS	The design of the study was a @-week single-blind randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	The study was conducted in the primary care practices at three VA medical centers .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to treatment in ACM or standard treatment in a specialty outpatient addiction treatment program .
METHODS	One hundred and sixty-three alcohol-dependent veterans were randomized .
METHODS	ACM focused on the use of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial support .
METHODS	ACM was delivered in-person or by telephone within the primary care clinic .
METHODS	Engagement in treatment and heavy alcohol consumption .
RESULTS	The ACM condition had a significantly higher proportion of participants engaged in treatment over the @weeks [ OR = @ , @ % CI = ( @ , @ ) ] .
RESULTS	The percentage of heavy drinking days were significantly lower in the ACM condition [ OR = @ , @ % CI = ( @ , @ ) ] , while overall abstinence did not differ between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Results demonstrate that treatment for an alcohol use disorder can be delivered effectively within primary care , leading to greater rates of engagement in treatment and greater reductions in heavy drinking .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the impact of fast-track surgery ( FTS ) on hospital stay , cost of hospitalization and complications after radical total gastrectomy .
METHODS	A randomized , controlled clinical trial was conducted from November @ to August @ in the Department of Digestive Surgery , Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases , the Fourth Military Medical University .
METHODS	A total of @ gastric cancer patients who met the selection criteria were randomized into FTS and conventional care groups on the first day of hospitalization .
METHODS	All patients received elective standard D@ total gastrectomy .
METHODS	Clinical outcomes , including duration of flatus and defecation , white blood cell count , postoperative pain , duration of postoperative stay , cost of hospitalization and complications were recorded and evaluated .
METHODS	Two specially trained doctors who were blinded to the treatment were in charge of evaluating postoperative outcomes , discharge and follow-up .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients finished the study , including @ patients in the conventional care group and @ patients in the FTS group .
RESULTS	Two patients were excluded from the FTS group due to withdrawal of consent .
RESULTS	One patient was excluded from the conventional care group because of a non-resectable tumor .
RESULTS	Compared with the conventional group , FTS shortened the duration of flatus ( @ @ h vs @ @ h , P = @ ) and duration of defecation ( @ @ h vs @ @ h , P = @ ) , accelerated the decrease in white blood cell count [ P < @ on postoperative day ( POD ) @ and @ ] , alleviated pain in patients after surgery ( P < @ on POD @ , @ and @ ) , reduced complications ( P < @ ) , shortened the duration of postoperative stay ( @ @ d vs @ @ d , P = @ ) , reduced the cost of hospitalization ( @ @ RMB vs @ @ RMB , P = @ ) , and promoted recovery of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	FTS could be safely applied in radical total gastrectomy to accelerate clinical recovery of gastric cancer patients .

BACKGROUND	In immunosuppressed patients with acute respiratory insufficiency ( ARI ) mechanical ventilation is associated with a high mortality .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , in this situation , avoidance of intubation could be an important objective .
BACKGROUND	However , experience of non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) in the immunosuppressed remains limited .
BACKGROUND	The first descriptive studies have shown that NIV could be an alternative to intubation , particularly in patients with malignant haematological disorders .
BACKGROUND	In a prospective randomised controlled study Antonelli et al. showed that the use of NIV significantly improved the prognosis of patients with ARI following organ transplantation .
BACKGROUND	We have carried out a prospective randomised controlled trial in @ immunosuppressed patients to determine whether NIV improved the prognosis in patients admitted to intensive care with pulmonary infiltrates , fever and ARI .
BACKGROUND	The use of NIV was associated with significant reductions in the intubation rate , serious complications and ICU and hospital mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed in order to better define the patients susceptible to benefit from NIV , and to establish variables predictive of the success or the failure of the method .
CONCLUSIONS	NIV leads to an improvement in the prognosis of some immunosuppressed patients admitted to intensive care .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of isocaloric , isonitrogenous carbohydrate nutrition vs. lipid-based total parenteral nutrition on respiratory gas exchange and intermediary metabolism in critically ill patients .
METHODS	Prospective , clinical trial .
METHODS	Surgical intensive care unit in a major university hospital in Switzerland .
METHODS	Sixteen patients admitted to the surgical intensive care unit .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive isocaloric isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) containing @ % ( TPN-glucose ) or @ % ( TPN-lipid ) glucose over a @-day period .
RESULTS	Indirect glucose metabolism was assessed from plasma carbon-@ ( @C ) - labeled glucose and @C-labeled CO@ production during a tracer infusion of uniformly @C-labeled glucose , and de novo lipogenesis was estimated from the incorporation of @C into palmitate-very low density lipoproteins ( VLDL ) during a tracer infusion of @ - ( @ ) C acetate .
RESULTS	Compared with TPN-lipid , TPN-glucose increased plasma glucose more ( by @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) , increased insulin more ( by @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) , and increased total CO@ more ( by @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Both nutrient mixtures failed to inhibit endogenous glucose production and net protein oxidation , suggesting absence of suppression of gluconeogenesis .
RESULTS	Fractional de novo lipogenesis was markedly increased by TPN-glucose to @ % vs. @ % with TPN lipids .
CONCLUSIONS	The rate of glucose administration commonly used during TPN of critically ill patients does not suppress endogenous glucose production or net protein loss , but markedly stimulates de novo lipogenesis and CO@ production .
CONCLUSIONS	Increasing the proportion of fat may be beneficial , provided that lipid emulsion has no adverse effects .

###24478399
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to identify the profile of circulating microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in type @ diabetes ( T@D ) and its response to changes in insulin sensitivity .
METHODS	The circulating miRNA profile was assessed in a pilot study of @ men : @ with normal glucose tolerance ( NGT ) and @ T@D patients .
METHODS	The association of @ circulating miRNAs with T@D was cross-sectionally validated in an extended sample of @ NGT vs. @ T@D subjects ( @ nonobese and @ obese men ) and longitudinally in @ T@D patients who were recruited in a randomized , double-blinded , and placebo-controlled @-month trial of metformin treatment .
METHODS	Circulating miRNAs were also measured in seven healthy volunteers before and after a @-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and insulin plus intralipid/heparin infusion .
RESULTS	Cross-sectional studies disclosed a marked increase of miR-@-@p , miR-@-@p , and miR-@ and decreased miR-@-@p , miR-@b , miR-@ , miR-@ , miR-@b , miR-@-@p , and miR-@ in T@D patients .
RESULTS	Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that miR-@-@p and miR-@-@p contributed independently to explain @ % ( P < @ ) of fasting glucose variance after controlling for confounders .
RESULTS	A discriminant function of four miRNAs ( miR-@-@p , miR-@-@p , miR-@ , and miR-@ ) was specific for T@D with an accuracy of @ % ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Metformin ( but not placebo ) led to significant changes in circulating miR-@ ( @ % ; P = @ ) , miR-@-@p ( -@ % ; P = @ ) , and miR-@ ( -@ % ; P = @ ) , in parallel to decreased fasting glucose and HbA@c .
RESULTS	Furthermore , while insulin infusion during clamp decreased miR-@ ( -@ % ; P = @ ) , the intralipid/heparin mixture increased circulating miR-@ ( @ % ; P = @ ) and miR-@-@p ( @ % ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study depicts the close association between variations in circulating miRNAs and T@D and their potential relevance in insulin sensitivity .

###20224060
OBJECTIVE	The modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) is a popular primary stroke outcome measure , but its usefulness is limited by suboptimal reliability ( inter-rater agreement ) .
METHODS	We developed and tested the reliability of a simplified mRS questionnaire ( smRSq ) in @ patients after stroke seen in outpatient clinics .
METHODS	Randomly chosen paired raters administered the smRSq within @ minutes of each other and the ratings were blinded until the end of this study .
RESULTS	Agreement among the raters was @ % , the kappa statistic was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and the weighted kappa ( w ) statistic taking into account the extent of disagreement was @ ( @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The average time to administer the smRSq was @ minutes .
CONCLUSIONS	The smRSq appears to have very good reliability that is similar to that of a structured interview mRS and is considerably less time-consuming .

BACKGROUND	Neonatal mortality is the biggest contributor to global mortality of children younger than @ years , and low birthweight is a crucial underlying factor .
BACKGROUND	We tested the hypotheses that antenatal multiple micronutrient supplementation would increase infant birthweight and gestational duration .
METHODS	We did a double-blind , randomised controlled trial in Dhanusha district , Nepal .
METHODS	Women attending for antenatal care with singleton pregnancies at up to @ weeks ' gestation were invited to participate .
METHODS	Participants were randomly allocated either routine iron and folic acid supplements ( control ; n = @ ) or a multiple micronutrient supplement providing a recommended daily allowance of @ vitamins and minerals ( intervention ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Supplementation began at a minimum of @ weeks ' gestation and continued until delivery .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures were birthweight and gestational duration .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	The study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	Birthweight was available for @/@ infants in the control group and @/@ in the intervention group .
RESULTS	Mean birthweight was @ g ( SD @ ) in the control group and @ g ( @ ) in the intervention group , representing a mean difference of @ g ( @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) and a relative fall in the proportion of low birthweight by @ % .
RESULTS	No difference was recorded in the duration of gestation ( @ weeks [ -@ to @ ] ; p = @ ) , infant length ( @ cm [ -@ to @ ] ; p = @ ) , or head circumference ( @ cm [ -@ to @ ] ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In a poor community in Nepal , consumption of a daily supplement containing a recommended daily allowance of @ micronutrients in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was associated with increased birthweight when compared with a standard iron and folic acid preparation .

BACKGROUND	The combination of bone replacement graft materials has been suggested for the treatment of periodontal osseous defects .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of enamel matrix derivative ( EMD ) combined with a bovine-derived xenograft ( BDX ) as compared to EMD alone in the treatment of intraosseous defects in patients with moderate to advanced periodontitis .
METHODS	Sixteen adult patients with at least @ intrabony defects were entered in this split-mouth design study .
METHODS	Defects were treated with EMD alone or EMD + BDX .
METHODS	Reentries were performed @ to @ months after initial surgery .
METHODS	The following soft and hard tissue measurements were recorded prior to initial surgery and at reentry : probing depth ( PD ) , gingival margin location , clinical attachment level ( CAL ) , depth of defect , and crestal bone level .
METHODS	Statistical analyses were performed to determine changes in PD , CAL , fill of osseous defect , and crestal resorption .
METHODS	Percentages of bone fill ( % BF ) and defect resolution ( % DR ) were also calculated .
RESULTS	The most significant results were that gingival recession was greater for the group treated with EMD alone ( @ + / - @ mm ) compared to EMD + BDX ( @ + / - @ mm ) ( P = @ ) and bone fill was greater for EMD + BDX ( @ + / - @ mm ) compared to EMD alone ( @ + / - @ mm ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The measures for PD reduction , attachment level gain , crestal resorption , % BF , and % DR did not present a statistically significant difference ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study evaluated the performance of EMD + BDX and EMD alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The results demonstrated that a significant improvement in clinical parameters was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	When comparing both modalities , a statistically significant difference was only found for gingival recession and bone fill , yielding a more favorable outcome towards the combined approach .

BACKGROUND	Preadipocyte factor @ ( pref-@ ) is increased in anorexia nervosa and is associated negatively with bone mineral density ( BMD ) .
BACKGROUND	No previous studies exist on pref-@ in women with exercise-induced hypothalamic amenorrhea ( HA ) , which similar to anorexia nervosa , is an energy-deficiency state associated with hypoleptinemia .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to evaluate whether pref-@ levels are also elevated and associated with low BMD and to assess whether leptin regulates pref-@ levels in women with HA .
METHODS	Study @ was a double-blinded , placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of metreleptin administration in women with HA .
METHODS	Study @ was an open-label study of metreleptin administration in low physiological , supraphysiological , and pharmacological doses in healthy women volunteers .
METHODS	At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , @ women with HA and leptin levels higher than @ ng/ml and nine healthy control women participated in study @ , and five healthy women participated in study @ .
METHODS	For study @ , @ HA subjects were randomized to receive either @ mg/kg metreleptin ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	For study @ , five healthy subjects received @ , @ , and @ mg/kg metreleptin in both fed and fasting conditions for @ and @ d , respectively .
METHODS	Circulating pref-@ and leptin levels were measured .
RESULTS	Pref-@ was significantly higher in HA subjects vs. controls ( P = @ ) and negatively associated with BMD ( = -@ ; P < @ ) and bone mineral content ( = -@ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Metreleptin administration did not alter pref-@ levels in any study reported herein .
CONCLUSIONS	Pref-@ is higher in HA subjects than controls .
CONCLUSIONS	Metreleptin administration at low physiological , supraphysiological , and pharmacological doses does not affect pref-@ levels , suggesting that hypoleptinemia is not responsible for higher pref-@ levels and that leptin does not regulate pref-@ .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the repeatability of the forearm blood flow response to intra-arterial infusion of endothelin-@ ( ET-@ ) , assessed by venous occlusion - plethysmography .
METHODS	In eight healthy men ( aged @-@ years ) , on four separate occasions , ET-@ ( @ or @ pmol min-@ ) was infused for @ min via a @ SWG cannula sited in the brachial artery of the nondominant arm .
METHODS	Each dose level was administered twice on consecutive visits .
METHODS	The dose order was randomized .
METHODS	Results are expressed as percentage change from baseline at @ min ( mean + / - s.e. mean ) .
RESULTS	ET-@ caused significant vasoconstriction ( P < @ anova ) at both doses ( @ + / - @ % , @ pmol min-@ and @ + / - @ % , @ pmol min-@ ; mean visit @ and @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the response to either dose on repeated challenge .
RESULTS	Responses appeared to be less variable when expressed as percentage change in the ratio of blood flow ( infused : noninfused ) in both arms than as percentage change in blood flow in the infused arm alone , as indicated by repeatability coefficients ( @ % vs @ % , @ pmol min-@ and @ % vs @ % , @ pmol min-@ ; ratio vs infused arm alone ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We have shown dose-dependent vasoconstriction in the forearm vascular bed to intra-arterial infusion of ET-@ and that this response is less variable when expressed as percentage change in the ratio of forearm blood flow than percentage change in the infused arm .
CONCLUSIONS	These data should also provide useful information to determine the power of early clinical pharmacology studies investigating the activity of endothelin receptor antagonists .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of sucralfate , ranitidine , and omeprazole use on incidence of ventilatory-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) and mortality in ventilated pediatric critical care patients .
METHODS	This prospective study was conducted at the pediatric intensive care unit ( PICU ) between August @ and February @ .
METHODS	A total of @ patients who needed mechanical ventilation were randomized into @ groups according to the computer-generated random number table : group ( S ) , ( n = @ ) received sucralfate suspension @ mg/kg/d in @ doses via the nasogastric tube that was flushed with @ mL of sterile water ; group ( R ) , ( n = @ ) received ranitidine @ mg/kg/d intravenously in @ doses ; group ( O ) , ( n = @ ) received omeprazole @ mg/kg/d intravenously in @ doses ; and group ( P ) , ( n = @ ) did not receive any medication for stress ulcer prophylaxis .
METHODS	Treatment was begun within @ hours of PICU admission .
RESULTS	Seventy patients ( @ % ) developed VAP .
RESULTS	VAP rate was @ % ( @ of @ ) in the sucralfate group , @ % ( @ of @ ) in the ranitidine group , @ % ( @ of @ ) in the omeprazole group , and @ % ( @ of @ ) in the nontreated group .
RESULTS	Overall mortality rate was @ % ( @ of @ ) ; it was @ % ( @ of @ ) in the sucralfate group , @ % ( @ of @ ) in the ranitidine group , @ % ( @ of @ ) in the omeprazole group , and @ % ( @ of @ ) in the nontreated group .
RESULTS	Our results did not show any difference in the incidence of VAP and mortality in mechanically ventilated PICU patients treated with ranitidine , omeprazole , or sucralfate , or nontreated subjects ( P = @ , confidence interval [ CI ] = @-@ @ ; P = @ , CI = @-@ @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Nine patients ( @ % ) had macroscopic bleeding .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in macroscopic bleeding between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results did not show any difference in the incidence of VAP , macroscopic stress ulcer bleeding , and mortality in the mechanically ventilated PICU patients treated with ranitidine , omeprazole , or sucralfate , or nontreated subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	None of the treatment regimens increased VAP compared with the nontreated group .
CONCLUSIONS	Because there is insufficient data about stress ulcer prophylaxis and VAP in the pediatric age group , more studies with larger numbers of patients are needed .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the quality-of-life effects of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa-@b ( IFN alpha @b ) treatment of high-risk melanoma .
METHODS	A quality-of-life-adjusted survival analysis ( Quality-Adjusted Time Without Symptoms , and Toxicity [ Q-TWiST ] ) was applied to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial E@ , which compared high-dose IFN alpha @b treatment for @ year versus observation in @ high-risk patients .
METHODS	IFN alpha @b was administered at a dosage of @ mU/m@ intravenously daily for @ days per week for @ weeks , and then three times weekly at @ mU/m@ subcutaneously for @ weeks .
RESULTS	After @ months of median follow-up time , the IFN alpha @b group gained a mean of @ months without disease relapse ( P = @ ) and @ months of overall survival ( P = @ ) as compared with the observation group , but had severe treatment-related toxicity for @ months , on average .
RESULTS	The IFN alpha @b group had more quality-of-life-adjusted time than the observation group regardless of the relative valuations placed on time with toxicity ( Tox ) and time with relapse ( Rel ) .
RESULTS	This gain was significant ( P < @ ) for patients who consider Tox to have a high relative value and Rel to have a low relative value .
RESULTS	In contrast , for patients who value Tox about the same as Rel , the quality-adjusted gain for IFN alpha @b was not statistically significant .
RESULTS	An analysis stratified according to tumor burden indicated that the benefit of IFN alpha @b was greatest in the node-positive strata .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with high-risk melanoma , the clinical benefits of high-dose IFN alpha @b can offset the toxic effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The optimal treatment for an individual patient depends on the patient 's tumor burden and preferences regarding toxicity and disease relapse .

BACKGROUND	While the formation of the dentin/adhesive hybrid layer has been generally established , the infiltration and flow of the adhesive resin inside the acid treated dentinal tubules remains controversial .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to investigate and review the current interpretation of resin tags by means of scanning electron microscopic ( SEM ) observation .
METHODS	Eight noncarious , human third molars were cut transversally and then longitudinally to obtain @ middle-to-deep dentinal surfaces .
METHODS	The dentin was etched with @ % phosphoric acid ( H @ PO @ ) gel for @ seconds and then rinsed with water for @ seconds .
METHODS	The dentin was kept moist by removing the excess water with a damp cotton pellet .
METHODS	The conditioned dentin was treated with a dentin bonding agent ( Single Bond ) and was light-polymerized for @ seconds .
METHODS	A @ - to @-mm layer of flowable composite ( Tetric Flow ) was then applied to the bonded dentin followed by @ layers ( @ mm each ) of composite ( Z @ ) .
METHODS	Each composite was light-polymerized for @ seconds .
METHODS	Subsequently , the specimens were cut lengthwise into @ halves and randomly divided into @ groups ( n = @ ) , according to the surface preparation modality of the sectioned surface : Group EA : ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid , Group PA@ : H @ PO @ , Group PA@ : H @ PO @ + NaOCl , and Group CA : HCl + NaOCl .
METHODS	Two additional teeth ( Group N ) were cut lengthwise into @ halves and served as the control .
METHODS	The sectioned surfaces were treated with HCl and NaOCl .
METHODS	All specimens were processed for SEM observation .
RESULTS	Specimens from Groups EA , PA@ , PA@ , CA , and N showed filamentous structures that were tens of microns long .
RESULTS	Some filaments presented split-ends with hollow structures and very thin walls .
RESULTS	Others made sharp hairpin turns indicating they were soft and compliant .
CONCLUSIONS	Conventional SEM techniques , which are currently used to detect resin tags , actually identified filamentous organic structures , supposedly glycosaminoglycans , which were resistant to conventional specimen preparation techniques .
CONCLUSIONS	The organic component showed a strong resemblance to the lamina limitans contained within the dentinal tubules .
CONCLUSIONS	Over-reliance on SEM morphology has led to much confusion about the depth of penetration of resin tags .

METHODS	Sixty patients , recruited from our outpatient department , were assigned randomly to receive an ultraviolet-filter IOL ( clear IOL group ) or a blue light-filter IOL ( yellow IOL group ) combined with a vitreoretinal procedure .
METHODS	Main outcome measures were intraoperative conditions for the surgeon and the functional outcome .
METHODS	Second outcome measures were complication rates and vitreoretinal diagnoses .
RESULTS	The questionnaire responses showed that the blue light-filter IOLs did not represent an impediment to vitreoretinal surgery ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	No intraoperative complications were encountered in either group .
RESULTS	Patients in both IOL groups showed comparable functional results with respect to visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , color vision , and glare effect ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The functional outcome was influenced significantly by the vitreoretinal diagnosis ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	With the possible advantage of macular protection and no intraoperative or functional disadvantage , the routine use of the blue light-filter IOL in combined surgery can be recommended .

OBJECTIVE	Arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids ( lipoxins and @-epilipoxins ) have a major role in resolution of inflammation .
OBJECTIVE	@-epi-lipoxin A ( @ ) ( @-epi-LXA ( @ ) ) is a lipid mediator with strong anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving effects .
OBJECTIVE	We examined the effect of pioglitazone therapy on plasma @-epi-LXA ( @ ) in patients with type @ diabetes ( T@DM ) .
METHODS	T@DM patients ( Age = @ @ y , BMI = @ @ , HbA@c = @ @ % ) not on thiazolidinedione therapy for at least @ months were randomized to receive either pioglitazone @ mg/daily for two months ( PIO @ ) or pioglitazone @ mg/day for one month followed by a dose escalation to @ mg/day for an additional one month ( PIO @ ) .
RESULTS	PIO @ increased plasma @-epi-LXA ( @ ) levels ( @ @-@ @ @ ng/mL , p < @ ) and adiponectin levels ( @ @-@ @ @ g/mL , p < @ ) and decreased fasting plasma glucose ( @ @-@ @ mg/dL , p < @ ) , free fatty acids ( FFA ) ( @ @-@ @ mol/l , p < @ ) and HOMA-IR ( @ @ to @ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Body weight ( = @ kg ) and HbA@c ( @ @-@ @ @ % ) did not change significantly .
RESULTS	PIO @ treated patients had similar increase in plasma @-epi-LXA ( @ ) ( @ @-@ @ @ ng/mL , p < @ ) , and decrease in plasma FFA ( @ @-@ @ mol/l , p < @ ) despite a greater increase in plasma adiponectin ( @ @-@ @ @ ug/mL , p < @ ) and a greater reduction in HbA@c ( @ @-@ @ @ % , p < @ ) , FPG ( @ @-@ @ mg/dL , p < @ ) , and HOMA-IR ( @ @-@ @ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , PIO @ treated patients had a significant increase in body weight ( = @ kg , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In T@DM , low dose pioglitazone ( @ mg/day ) increases @-epi-LXA ( @ ) and adiponectin levels in the absence of significant changes in body weight .
CONCLUSIONS	Dose escalation of pioglitazone to @ mg/day is associated with a similar increase in @-epi-LXA ( @ ) despite a greater increase in plasma adiponectin concentrations .

BACKGROUND	Early integration of HIV proviral DNA into the host cell genome prevents viral eradication , despite suppressive HAART .
BACKGROUND	In vitro , integrase inhibitors reduce proviral DNA levels and rapidly increase @-long-terminal repeat ( LTR ) circle levels .
BACKGROUND	We examined the effect of raltegravir on the time course of HIV-@ DNA forms in patients with controlled viremia .
METHODS	The EASIER-ANRS @ randomized trial demonstrated that switching from enfuvirtide to raltegravir maintained virological suppression in treatment-experienced patients with viral load below @ copies/ml .
METHODS	We analyzed total HIV-@ DNA and @-LTR circle levels measured at weeks ( W ) @ and @ in the first @ patients enrolled in each arm , and at W@ in the raltegravir arm .
RESULTS	At W@ the total DNA level was @ log ( @ ) / @ ( @ ) peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) in both groups , and @-LTR circles were detected in six patients ( median @ copies/@ ( @ ) PBMC ) .
RESULTS	At W@ the total DNA level was @ log ( @ ) / @ ( @ ) PBMC in both groups , and @-LTR circles were detected in three new patients .
RESULTS	At W@ the total HIV DNA level in the raltegravir group was @ log ( @ ) / @ ( @ ) PBMC , and @-LTR circles were undetectable .
RESULTS	No significant change in total HIV DNA occurred between W@ and W@ in either arm ( P = @ ) and no significant change was observed in the raltegravir arm at W@ .
CONCLUSIONS	In most patients on effective HAART , including regimens containing an integrase inhibitor , the viral reservoir , reflected by the HIV-@ DNA load , is stable and nondynamic during the @ weeks of follow-up .

BACKGROUND	The relationship between loss of radiographic alveolar bone height and probing attachment loss has been studied by a number of investigators , with mixed results .
BACKGROUND	Recent studies have found weak correlations and have suggested that the relationship between bone loss and attachment loss is complex , perhaps because changes in bone height and attachment level are separated in time .
METHODS	The @ patients in this report were part of a prospective estrogen replacement interventional study .
METHODS	All patients were in good oral health at entry and received annual oral prophylaxis as part of the study .
METHODS	Standard probing measurements were made with a pressure-sensitive probe at @ sites on each tooth .
METHODS	Vertical bite-wing radiographs were taken of each patient , radiographs were digitized , and @ linear measurements ( corresponding to probing site measurements ) were made from the cemento-enamel junction to the alveolar crest .
METHODS	These procedures were performed at baseline and at annual intervals ; this study reports results after @ years .
METHODS	Data were analyzed both by individual site and by averaging identical sites from all measured teeth for each patient .
RESULTS	Very weak direct relationships between change in alveolar bone height and change in attachment level were found in both the site data ( r@ = @ ; P = @ ) and the patient average data ( r@ = @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The changes in these patients were probably due to systemic changes in bone health rather than to periodontal disease .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the weak correlations between changes in attachment level and bone height are similar to recent studies of periodontal disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results support suggestions in the literature that the link between changes in attachment and alveolar bone height is complex , perhaps because changes in the @ tissue types are separated by a considerable time delay .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of acupuncture on the morphine-related side effects ( nausea , vomiting , itchiness and gastrointestinal disorders ) in patients undergoing anesthesia and analgesia and try to find the clinical mechanism of acupuncture .
METHODS	Patients scheduled to have transurethral prostatic resection : enrolled in the study ( @ patients ) , characterized as Grade II or III by the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification , were randomly assigned to three groups , @ patients in each group : the placebo group ( control group ) , non-anesthesia area ( NAA ) group , and the anesthesia area ( AA ) group .
METHODS	After spinal anesthesia , all patients received Patients Controlled Epidural Analgesia .
METHODS	The vital signs , bowel sounds , visual analogue scales , itchiness , nausea and vomiting , and time for first exhaust post operation were observed .
RESULTS	Altogether , nine cases were eliminated , three in each group .
RESULTS	Finally , sixty cases completed this study , : twenty in each group .
RESULTS	There was a significant decrease of bowel sounds after morphine spinal anesthesia in the three groups .
RESULTS	Compared with the control or AA group , the bowel sound recovered after acupuncture , the incidences of nausea and vomiting , itchiness , and time for first exhaust after operation decreased in the NAA group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant decrease of the incidence for itchiness in the NAA group compared with < the control group ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	On the basis of this study , it is obviously seen that acupuncture could : decrease the incidence of morphine-related side effects ( nausea and vomiting , itchiness and gastrointestinal disorders ) when the spinal cord conduct is normal .
CONCLUSIONS	However , it decreases only the incidence of itchiness but not for gastrointestinal dysfunction when the spinal cord is blocked .

BACKGROUND	Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce mortality in patients with tuberculous meningitis but the long-term outcome of the disease is unknown .
METHODS	Vietnamese adults and adolescents with tuberculous meningitis recruited to a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of adjunctive dexamethasone were followed-up at five years , to determine the effect of dexamethasone on long-term survival and neurological disability .
RESULTS	@ patients were randomised to receive either dexamethasone ( @ patients ) or placebo ( @ patients ) .
RESULTS	@ patients ( @ % ) were lost to follow-up at five years .
RESULTS	In all patients two-year survival , probabilities tended to be higher in the dexamethasone arm ( @ versus @ ; p = @ ) but five-year survival rates were similar ( @ versus @ , p = @ ) in both groups .
RESULTS	In patients with grade @ TBM , but not with grade @ or grade @ TBM , the benefit of dexamethasone treatment tended to persist over time ( five-year survival probabilities @ versus @ , p = @ ) but there was no conclusive evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity by TBM grade ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The dexamethasone group had a similar proportion of severely disabled patients among survivors at five years as the placebo group ( @/@ , @ % vs. @/@ , @ % ) and there was no significant association between dexamethasone treatment and disability status at five years ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Adjunctive dexamethasone appears to improve the probability of survival in patients with TBM , until at least two years of follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	We could not demonstrate a five-year survival benefit of dexamethasone treatment which may be confined to patients with grade @ TBM .

OBJECTIVE	We carried out a secondary analysis in high-risk patients with a previous myocardial infarction ( MI ) and diabetes in the Alpha Omega Trial .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that in these patients an increased intake of the n-@ fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , and - linolenic acid ( ALA ) will reduce the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and fatal MI .
METHODS	A subgroup of @,@ post-MI patients with diabetes aged @-@ years was randomly allocated to receive one of four trial margarines , three with an additional amount of n-@ fatty acids and one placebo for @ months .
METHODS	The end points were ventricular arrhythmia-related events and fatal MI .
METHODS	The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle , using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models .
RESULTS	The patients consumed on average @ g of margarine per day , which resulted in an additional intake of @ mg EPA plus @ mg DHA and/or @ g ALA in the active treatment groups .
RESULTS	During follow-up , @ patients developed a ventricular arrhythmia-related events and @ had a fatal MI .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo patients , the EPA-DHA plus ALA group experienced less ventricular arrhythmia-related events ( hazard ratio @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	These n-@ fatty acids also reduced the combined end-point ventricular arrhythmia-related events and fatal MI ( @ ; @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that low-dose supplementation of n-@ fatty acids exerts a protective effect against ventricular arrhythmia-related events in post-MI patients with diabetes .

BACKGROUND	Clozapine , a relatively expensive antipsychotic drug , is widely used to treat patients with refractory schizophrenia .
BACKGROUND	It has a low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects but may cause agranulocytosis .
BACKGROUND	There have been no long-term assessments of its effect on symptoms , social functioning , and the use and cost of health care .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , one-year , double-blind comparative study of clozapine ( in @ patients ) and haloperidol ( in @ patients ) at @ Veterans Affairs medical centers .
METHODS	All participants had refractory schizophrenia and had been hospitalized for the disease for @ to @ days in the previous year .
METHODS	All patients received case-management and social-rehabilitation services , as clinically indicated .
RESULTS	In the clozapine group , @ patients ( @ percent ) continued their assigned treatment for the entire year , as compared with @ ( @ percent ) of the patients in the haloperidol group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	As judged according to the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale of Schizophrenia , patients in the clozapine group had @ percent lower symptom levels than those in the haloperidol group at all follow-up evaluations ( mean score , @ vs. @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The differences on a quality-of-life scale were not significant in the intention-to-treat analysis , but they were significant among patients who did not cross over to the other treatment ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Over a one-year period , patients assigned to clozapine had fewer mean days of hospitalization for psychiatric reasons than patients assigned to haloperidol ( @ vs. @ days , P = @ ) and used more outpatient services ( @ vs. @ units of service , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The total per capita costs to society were high -- $ @,@ in the clozapine group and $ @,@ in the haloperidol group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The per capita costs of antipsychotic drugs were $ @,@ in the clozapine group and $ @ in the haloperidol group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients assigned to clozapine had less tardive dyskinesia and fewer extrapyramidal side effects .
RESULTS	Agranulocytosis developed in three patients in the clozapine group ; all recovered fully .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with refractory schizophrenia and high levels of hospital use , clozapine was somewhat more effective than haloperidol and had fewer side effects and similar overall costs .

###20143047
OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to examine the effects of drug therapy alone and combined with behavioral therapy on urgency and @-voiding frequency in women with urge-predominant incontinence and to identify predictors of change .
METHODS	A planned analysis of data from a multi-site , randomized , controlled trial ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Bladder diaries were used to document voids , incontinence , and urgency severity .
RESULTS	Urgency scores decreased significantly within both treatment groups , but changes did not differ between groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Improvement in urgency was associated with greater baseline urgency ( p < @ ) and black ethnicity ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Voiding frequency increased with drug alone and decreased slightly with combined therapy ( p = @ ) , and improvement was associated with combined treatment ( p < @ ) , higher baseline frequency ( p < @ ) , and lower baseline incontinence episode frequency ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although combined drug and behavioral therapy does not appear to improve urgency more than drug alone , it resulted in better outcomes on voiding frequency .

BACKGROUND	As current dengue control strategies have been shown to be largely ineffective in reducing dengue in school-aged children , novel approaches towards dengue control need to be studied .
BACKGROUND	Insecticide-impregnated school uniforms represent an innovative approach with the theoretical potential to reduce dengue infections in school children .
OBJECTIVE	This study took place in the context of a randomised control trial ( RCT ) to test the effectiveness of permethrin-impregnated school uniforms ( ISUs ) for dengue prevention in Chachoengsao Province , Thailand .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to assess the acceptability of ISUs among parents , teachers , and principals of school children involved in the trial .
METHODS	Quantitative and qualitative tools were used in a mixed methods approach .
METHODS	Class-clustered randomised samples of school children enrolled in the RCT were selected and their parents completed @ self-administered questionnaires .
METHODS	Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyse the quantitative data .
METHODS	Focus group discussions and individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents , teachers , and principals .
METHODS	Qualitative data analysis involved content analysis with coding and thematic development .
RESULTS	The knowledge and experience of dengue was substantial .
RESULTS	The acceptability of ISUs was high .
RESULTS	Parents ( @ % ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) would allow their child to wear an ISU and @ % ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) of parents would incur additional costs for an ISU over a normal uniform .
RESULTS	This was significantly associated with the total monthly income of a household and the educational level of the respondent .
RESULTS	Parents ( @ % ; @ % CI @-@ @ ) indicated they would be willing to recommend ISUs to other parents .
CONCLUSIONS	Acceptability of the novel tool of ISUs was high as defined by the lack of concern along with the willingness to pay and recommend .
CONCLUSIONS	Considering issues of effectiveness and scalability , assessing acceptability of ISUs over time is recommended .

OBJECTIVE	Concord grape juice ( CGJ ) is a rich source of phenolic antioxidants , with a range of putative health benefits .
OBJECTIVE	However , high beverage energy and fructose intake may lead to weight gain and insulin resistance , respectively .
OBJECTIVE	This study assessed the effects of CGJ consumption for @ weeks on appetite , diet , body weight , lipid profile , and antioxidant status .
METHODS	Seventy-six men and women aged @ to @ years with a body mass index of @ to @ kg/m ( @ ) consumed either @ mL CGJ , @ mL substitute ( polyphenol-free ) grape-flavored drink ( SGD ) , or no beverage ( NTG ) daily for @ weeks .
METHODS	Anthropometric indices were measured biweekly , dietary intake and appetite were assessed @ times during the study , and plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity , lipids , and oral glucose tolerance were assessed at baseline and week @ .
RESULTS	Compared to baseline , the SGD group reported a reduction in fullness ( p < @ ) and gained @ kg ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant changes in body weight or composition were observed with CGJ or control ( no beverage added to diet ) .
RESULTS	Mean dietary compensation was @ % for SGD and @ % for CGJ .
RESULTS	Serum glucose and insulin area under the curve ( @ minutes ) increased slightly , but this was significant only with CGJ .
RESULTS	Plasma antioxidant capacity did not differ across groups , suggesting no effect of chronic CGJ ingestion on antioxidant status .
CONCLUSIONS	Daily consumption of CGJ for @ weeks did not lead to significant weight gain , but consumption of SGD did .
CONCLUSIONS	The basis of this differential response could not be documented , but it is hypothesized to be a result of dietary compensation and effects of CGJ polyphenols on thermogenesis and substrate oxidation .

BACKGROUND	Latanoprost effectively lowers intraocular pressure .
BACKGROUND	Because ischemia has gained increasing importance in the pathogenesis of glaucoma , an antiglaucomatous drug should also be investigated with regard to the influence on ocular hemodynamics .
METHODS	In a double masked , randomized , clinical trial , Latanoprost eye drops were administered to @ volunteers once daily for @ days and @ further volunteers received placebo eye drops according to the same protocol .
METHODS	IOP , blood pressure , heart rate , ocular pulse amplitudes , pulse volume , pulsatile ocular blood flow and contrast sensitivity were measured before ( @T@ ) , @ min after drop administration ( @T@ ) , after @ days of therapy ( @T@ ) and again @ min after an acute administration ( @T@ ) .
METHODS	For statistical analysis a two-way variance-analysis and the t-test for paired samples were used .
RESULTS	IOP was found to be statistically significantly different comparing both groups over the test period ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In Latanoprost-treated subjects the t-test revealed a significant drop in IOP between @T@ and @T@ ( p = @ ) and between @T@ and @T@ ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	All other above mentioned parameters remained constant .
CONCLUSIONS	In Latanoprost-treated subjects , a significant drop in intraocular pressure was observed after @ week .
CONCLUSIONS	However , ocular perfusion and contrast sensitivity did not change during therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	This might be due to an effective autoregulation in healthy volunteers .

###10735462
OBJECTIVE	To determine the haemodynamic effects of dopamine and volume expansion in preterm neonates .
OBJECTIVE	Effect parameters were mean arterial blood pressure ( MABP ) , left ventricular output ( LVO ) and global cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) .
METHODS	In a randomised , clinical control trial @ preterm neonates were randomised to receive either dopamine @ microg/kg per min , volume expansion with albumin @ % @ ml/kg or no treatment .
METHODS	Parameters were measured before and @ h after initiation of treatment .
RESULTS	Dopamine was effective in increasing MABP ; both treatments increased LVO , whereas no significant difference between the treatment groups and the control group could be demonstrated with regard to CBF .
CONCLUSIONS	No effect on global cerebral blood flow could be demonstrated in this study , despite significant effects on systemic circulatory parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the variance on the measurement of cerebral blood flow indicates that a small but clinically significant effect may have been overlooked .

BACKGROUND	Vascular access devices ( VADs ) , such as peripheral or central venous catheters , are vital across all medical and surgical specialties .
BACKGROUND	To allow therapy or haemodynamic monitoring , VADs frequently require administration sets ( AS ) composed of infusion tubing , fluid containers , pressure-monitoring transducers and/or burettes .
BACKGROUND	While VADs are replaced only when necessary , AS are routinely replaced every @-@days in the belief that this reduces infectious complications .
BACKGROUND	Strong evidence supports AS use up to @days , but there is less evidence for AS use beyond @days .
BACKGROUND	AS replacement twice weekly increases hospital costs and workload .
METHODS	This is a pragmatic , multicentre , randomised controlled trial ( RCT ) of equivalence design comparing AS replacement at @ ( control ) versus @ ( experimental ) days .
METHODS	Randomisation is stratified by site and device , centrally allocated and concealed until enrolment .
METHODS	@ adult/paediatric patients with a central venous catheter , peripherally inserted central catheter or peripheral arterial catheter will be enrolled over @years .
METHODS	The primary outcome is VAD-related bloodstream infection ( BSI ) and secondary outcomes are VAD colonisation , AS colonisation , all-cause BSI , all-cause mortality , number of AS per patient , VAD time in situ and costs .
METHODS	Relative incidence rates of VAD-BSI per @ devices and hazard rates per @ device days ( @ % CIs ) will summarise the impact of @-day relative to @-day AS use and test equivalence .
METHODS	Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( with log rank Mantel-Cox test ) will compare VAD-BSI over time .
METHODS	Appropriate parametric or non-parametric techniques will be used to compare secondary end points .
METHODS	p Values of < @ will be considered significant .
BACKGROUND	Relevant ethical approvals have been received .
BACKGROUND	CONSORT Statement recommendations will be used to guide preparation of any publication .
BACKGROUND	Results will be presented at relevant conferences and sent to the major organisations with clinical practice guidelines for VAD care .

METHODS	Maximum walking distance , claudication distance and ankle brachial pressure index .
RESULTS	Eighty-three percent of patients completed the study .
RESULTS	Improvements in median distance to claudication symptoms and maximum walking distance were observed in the intervention group but not in the control group .
RESULTS	Nine out of @ ( @ % ) participants in the control group and @ out of @ ( @ % ) participants in the intervention group improved their walking distance .
RESULTS	Ankle brachial pressure index remained virtually unchanged in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Due to the variability of patients ' fitness in the sample , it can not be concluded whether use of the Step It pedal has additional benefits to patients over standard care .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the study completion rate implies that patients with peripheral arterial disease are receptive to undertaking exercise programmes .

BACKGROUND	In-home iron fortification for infants in developing countries is recommended for control of anaemia , but low absorption typically results in > @ % of the iron passing into the colon .
BACKGROUND	Iron is essential for growth and virulence of many pathogenic enterobacteria .
BACKGROUND	We determined the effect of high and low dose in-home iron fortification on the infant gut microbiome and intestinal inflammation .
METHODS	We performed two double-blind randomised controlled trials in @-month-old Kenyan infants ( n = @ ) consuming home-fortified maize porridge daily for @ months .
METHODS	In the first , infants received a micronutrient powder ( MNP ) containing @ mg iron as NaFeEDTA or the MNP without iron .
METHODS	In the second , they received a different MNP containing @ mg iron as ferrous fumarate or the MNP without the iron .
METHODS	The primary outcome was gut microbiome composition analysed by @S pyrosequencing and targeted real-time PCR ( qPCR ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included faecal calprotectin ( marker of intestinal inflammation ) and incidence of diarrhoea .
METHODS	We analysed the trials separately and combined .
RESULTS	At baseline , @ % of the total microbial @S rRNA could be assigned to Bifidobacteriaceae but there were high prevalences of pathogens , including Salmonella Clostridium difficile , Clostridium perfringens , and pathogenic Escherichia coli .
RESULTS	Using pyrosequencing , + FeMNPs increased enterobacteria , particularly Escherichia/Shigella ( p = @ ) , the enterobacteria/bifidobacteria ratio ( p = @ ) , and Clostridium ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Most of these effects were confirmed using qPCR ; for example , + FeMNPs increased pathogenic E. coli strains ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	+ FeMNPs also increased faecal calprotectin ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	During the trial , @ % of infants in +@ mgFeMNP required treatment for diarrhoea versus @ % in -@ mgFeMNP ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no study-related serious adverse events in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	In this setting , provision of iron-containing MNPs to weaning infants adversely affects the gut microbiome , increasing pathogen abundance and causing intestinal inflammation .
BACKGROUND	NCT@ .

BACKGROUND	Multimodal pain-control protocols that include periarticular injections have been reported to decrease pain and improve early outcomes following total knee arthroplasty .
BACKGROUND	While injections containing a corticosteroid have been demonstrated to be safe and effective , we are not aware of any randomized trials in which the specific effect of the corticosteroid on early postoperative outcomes has been evaluated .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this double-blind study was to compare the clinical efficacy of periarticular injections consisting of bupivacaine , morphine , epinephrine , clonidine , and cefuroxime as well as a corticosteroid ( methylprednisolone acetate ) with the efficacy of periarticular injections consisting of the same agents but without the inclusion of a corticosteroid .
METHODS	Seventy-six patients were randomized to either the no-steroid group ( thirty-seven patients ) or the steroid group ( thirty-nine patients ) .
METHODS	Pain and narcotic consumption during the inpatient stay and the length of the hospital stay were recorded .
METHODS	Knee Society scores , the range of motion , and the occurrence of any complications were recorded preoperatively and at six and twelve weeks after the surgery .
RESULTS	The hospital stay was significantly shorter for patients in the steroid group ( @ days compared with @ days in the no-steroid group ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant group differences in terms of pain , narcotic consumption , outcome scores , or motion were identified .
RESULTS	There were three complications in the steroid group : two patients required a manipulation under anesthesia , and the knee joint became infected in another patient , leading to numerous complications and ultimately death .
CONCLUSIONS	The periarticular injection of a corticosteroid may reduce the length of the hospital stay following total knee arthroplasty , but it does not appear to improve pain relief , motion , or function in the early postoperative period .
CONCLUSIONS	While we can not definitively state that the corticosteroid was a causative factor in the development of the infection at the site of the prosthetic joint , we can not rule it out either , which raises concern regarding the role of corticosteroids in perioperative pain management following total knee arthroplasty .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of two Internet-based psycho-educational programs designed to improve outcomes for youth with type @ diabetes transitioning to adolescence .
METHODS	The study was a multisite clinical trial of @ youth ( aged @-@ years ; @ % minority ; @ % female ) randomized to one of two Internet-based interventions : TeenCope or Managing Diabetes .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were HbA@c and quality of life ( QOL ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes included coping , self-efficacy , social competence , self-management , and family conflict .
METHODS	Data were collected at baseline and after @ , @ , and @ months online .
METHODS	Youth were invited to cross over to the other program after @ months , and follow-up data were collected at @ months .
METHODS	Analyses were based on mixed models using intent-to-treat and per-protocol procedures .
RESULTS	Youth in both groups had stable QOL and minimal increases in HbA@c levels over @ months , but there were no significant differences between the groups in primary outcomes .
RESULTS	After @ months , youth who completed both programs had lower HbA@c ( P = @ ) ; higher QOL ( P = @ ) , social acceptance ( P = @ ) , and self-efficacy ( P = @ ) and lower perceived stress ( P = @ ) and diabetes family conflict ( P = @ ) compared with those who completed only one program .
CONCLUSIONS	Internet interventions for youth with type @ diabetes transitioning to adolescence result in improved outcomes , but completion of both programs was better than only one , suggesting that these youth need both diabetes management education and behavioral interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	Delivering these programs via the Internet represents an efficient way to reach youth and improve outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate use of educational audiotape programme on anxiety and depression in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) .
BACKGROUND	Anxiety and depression after CABG are the most common complications , having a negative impact on the prognosis of heart disease , leading to special needs according to their new physical and mental conditions .
METHODS	Randomised clinical trial .
METHODS	This study conducted in Iran , @ patients undergoing CABG were included and divided into two equal groups , the control group and intervention group .
METHODS	They were followed up for six weeks .
METHODS	An audiotape educational programme was given to the intervention group after surgery in addition to the routine training .
METHODS	But patients in the control group received only routine training .
METHODS	Anxiety and depression were assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , a standardised questionnaire for anxiety and depression .
METHODS	Data were collected before and six weeks after the intervention .
METHODS	For the comparison of mean scores between the groups , the data were analysed in spss , version @ , using independent T-test and paired T-test .
RESULTS	The mean scores obtained in both anxiety and depression dimensions were significantly different between the intervention and control groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Audiotape educational programme used by patients undergoing CABG decreases the level of their anxiety and depression after cardiac surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	The most significant finding was the importance of audiotape educational programme to meet the needs of the CABG patients , which suggest that patient education through audiotape can be effective in self-care after heart surgery and nurses can use an audiotape containing preparatory information to improve outcomes and reduce anxiety and depression in patients having CABG .

BACKGROUND	Despite national priorities in cancer control , the number of people with established ongoing medical care who do not receive indicated preventive services is substantial .
BACKGROUND	Proven strategies to optimize preventive care in community practice are limited .
METHODS	In the Cancer Prevention in Community Practice Project ( CPCP ) , @ primary care providers were randomly assigned to receive an `` office system '' intervention .
METHODS	The intervention led to reorganization of office operations based on four functional core components : identifying patients ' needs for services ; monitoring their status over time ; providing positive reinforcement to patients ; and establishing an internal feedback component consisting of a brief audit to assess how the system is operating .
METHODS	Implementation of the CPCP system in each practice was accomplished using trained facilitators , and involved incorporating one or more tools developed to meet the functional components of the practice .
RESULTS	One hundred percent of the practices were successful in implementing some changes in their office operations that met CPCP office system functional criteria .
RESULTS	All study practices implemented customized flow sheets , while use of other office system tools were incorporated at between @ % to @ % of study sites .
RESULTS	Identifying patients in need of preventive services was performed most often by the clinical staff ( @ % ) , whereas monitoring patients ' receipt of preventive services over time and reinforcing positive patient behavior were performed most often by physicians ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Changes made in practices were maintained for at least @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	Primary care practices in community settings can implement significant and lasting changes in their practice environment that will improve their performance of preventive activities .
CONCLUSIONS	The functional components of the CPCP office system design proposed and tested here are applicable to a wide variety of practice settings .

OBJECTIVE	Endothelial function is an independent predictor of prognosis in heart failure ( HF ) subjects .
OBJECTIVE	Statins , beyond their lipid lowering role , exert beneficial effect in patients with atherosclerosis .
OBJECTIVE	In the present study we examined the impact of low and intermediate dose atorvastatin treatment on endothelial function , bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells ( EPC ) mobilization and inflammatory status according to HF patient status .
METHODS	We studied the effect of @ weeks administration of atorvastatin in @ patients with ischemic HF .
METHODS	The study was carried out on two separate arms , one with atorvastatin @mg/d and one with atorvastatin @mg/d ( randomized , double-blind , cross-over design ) .
METHODS	The number of circulating CD@ ( + ) / CD@ ( + ) / KDR ( + ) EPCs was evaluated by flow cytometry .
METHODS	Endothelial function was evaluated by flow mediated dilation ( FMD ) in the brachial artery .
METHODS	Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF - ) were measured by ELISA .
RESULTS	Treatment with atorvastatin @mg/d significantly increased circulating EPC ( p = @ ) , FMD ( p = @ ) and reduced TNF - ( p = @ ) compared to baseline .
RESULTS	Similarly , treatment with atorvastatin @mg/day increased circulating EPC ( p = @ ) , FMD ( p = @ ) and reduced TNF - ( p = @ ) compared to baseline .
RESULTS	Interestingly , with @mg/day atorvastatin treatment the increase in EPC was higher in subjects categorized as NYHA class II compared to subjects categorized as NYHA class III ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results confirmed the distinct impact of atorvastatin treatment on the restoration of endothelial function due to EPC mobilization in ischemic HF subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	Moreover , these findings provide the potential clinical significance of EPC status monitoring to individualize treatment in HF subjects .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the clinical effect of electrocautery with arthroscopic chondroplasty on chondromalacic tissue .
METHODS	A randomized , prospective study .
METHODS	In a prospective study , @ patients were randomly placed in either a control group ( chondroplasty alone ) or a treatment group ( chondroplasty and electrocautery ) .
METHODS	Intraoperative findings in both treatment and control groups were classified by both the extent of chondromalacia and the number of compartments in which chondromalacia was diagnosed .
METHODS	In our study , we used @ defined compartments : medial and lateral tibial plateau , medial and lateral femoral condyles , patella , and femoral trochlea .
METHODS	Patients were followed up at @ year and evaluated using the Lysholm scale .
METHODS	Postoperative Lysholm scores were matched against compartment involvement and compared between groups .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the patients with grade @ chondromalacia in either control or cautery group ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Groups with grade @ chondromalacia showed a significant difference favoring the control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A significant difference was found in comparing @-compartment chondromalacia between the @ treatment cohorts , again , favoring the control group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The remaining groups of multiple compartment chondromalacia showed no significant difference , indicating that the postoperative result was independent of the use of electrocautery .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that electrocautery as an adjunct to chondroplasty offers little benefit in the treatment of chondromalacic lesions and may , in fact , limit successful outcome .

BACKGROUND	Tobacco smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death among American women .
BACKGROUND	Exercise has shown promise as an aid to smoking cessation because it reduces weight gain and weight concerns , improves affect , and reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cigarette craving .
BACKGROUND	Studies have shown that the practice of yoga improves weight control , and reduces perceived stress and negative affect .
BACKGROUND	Yoga practice also includes regulation of breathing and focused attention , both of which may enhance stress reduction and improve mood and well-being and may improve cessation outcomes .
METHODS	This pilot efficacy study is designed to examine the rates of cessation among women randomized to either a novel , @-week Yoga plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) smoking cessation intervention versus a Wellness program plus the same CBT smoking cessation intervention .
METHODS	Outcome measures include @-day point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment , @ and @ months follow up and potential mediating variables ( e.g. , confidence in quitting smoking , self-efficacy ) .
METHODS	Other assessments include measures of mindfulness , spirituality , depressive symptoms , anxiety and perceived health ( SF-@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Innovative treatments are needed that address barriers to successful smoking cessation among men and women .
CONCLUSIONS	The design chosen for this study will allow us to explore potential mediators of intervention efficacy so that we may better understand the mechanism ( s ) by which yoga may act as an effective complementary treatment for smoking cessation .
CONCLUSIONS	If shown to be effective , yoga can offer an alternative to traditional exercise for reducing negative symptoms that often accompany smoking cessation and predict relapse to smoking among recent quitters .

BACKGROUND	The primary aim of this randomized study was to describe the feasibility of early administration of surfactant via a thin catheter during spontaneous breathing ( Take Care ) and compare early mechanical ventilation ( MV ) requirement with the InSurE ( Intubate , Surfactant , Extubate ) procedure .
METHODS	Preterm infants , who were < @ weeks and stabilized with nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) in the delivery room , were randomized to receive early surfactant treatment either by the Take Care or InSurE technique .
METHODS	Tracheal instillation of @ mg/kg poractant via @-F catheter during spontaneous breathing under nCPAP was performed in the intervention group .
METHODS	In the InSurE procedure , infants were intubated , received positive pressure ventilation for @ seconds after surfactant instillation , and placed on nCPAP immediately .
RESULTS	One hundred infants in each group were analyzed .
RESULTS	The MV requirement in the first @ hours of life was significantly lower in the Take Care group when compared with the InSurE group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ , odds ratio -@ , @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ ) .
RESULTS	Mean duration of both nCPAP and MV were significantly shorter in the Take Care group ( P values @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Bronchopulmonary dysplasia rate was significantly lower among the infants treated with the Take Care technique ( relative risk -@ , @ % confidence interval -@ to -@ )
CONCLUSIONS	The Take Care technique is feasible for the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in infants with very low birth weight .
CONCLUSIONS	It significantly reduces both the need and duration of MV , and thus the bronchopulmonary dysplasia rate in preterm infants .

OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that methylphenidate modifies markers of fall risk in older adults .
METHODS	Randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-dose cross-over study .
METHODS	Outpatient movement disorders clinic .
METHODS	Twenty-six community-living older adults without dementia ( mean age @ ) with subjective complaints of `` memory problems . ''
METHODS	The study examined the effects of a single dose of @ mg of methylphenidate ( MPH ) on cognitive function and gait .
METHODS	Participants were evaluated before and @ hours after taking MPH or a placebo in sessions @ to @ weeks apart .
METHODS	The Timed Up and Go and gait variability quantified mobility and fall risk .
METHODS	A computerized neuropsychology battery quantified memory and executive function ( EF ) .
RESULTS	Timed Up and Go times , stride time variability , and measures of EF significantly improved in response to MPH but not in response to the placebo .
RESULTS	In contrast , MPH did not significantly affect memory or finger tapping abilities .
CONCLUSIONS	In older adults , MPH appears to improve certain aspects of EF , mobility , and gait stability .
CONCLUSIONS	Although additional studies are required to assess clinical utility and efficacy , the present findings suggest that methylphenidate and other drugs that are designed to enhance attention may have a role as a therapeutic option for reducing fall risk in older adults .

OBJECTIVE	Placing a Class II restoration in a tooth changes the local environment , including that for the adjacent tooth .
OBJECTIVE	Apart from the change to a less - or non-cariogenic environment for the restored tooth , the effect of leachable components from a restoration in the adjacent tooth should be taken into consideration .
METHODS	Practice-based clinical studies comprising of @ unrestored proximal surfaces in contact with Class II restorations using different restorative materials were reviewed to assess the effect on the caries development on the adjacent teeth .
METHODS	The caries status of the adjacent un-restored proximal surface was assessed as being clinically sound , having active caries with or without cavitation , or having arrested caries .
METHODS	Restorations from nine clinicians were reviewed .
METHODS	They had attended annual meetings where all aspects of the investigation had been discussed .
METHODS	The surfaces were followed for up to eight years .
RESULTS	A reduced rate of caries development and progression were found on surfaces in contact with fluoride releasing materials like glass ionomers , resin modified glass ionomers and compomers compared to surfaces in contact with amalgam .
CONCLUSIONS	Fluoride releasing materials reduce the development and progression of primary caries on adjacent proximal surfaces .

OBJECTIVE	Effects of combined nutritional treatment of patients at risk of protein-energy malnutrition ( PEM ) discharged from a geriatric service were evaluated .
METHODS	Patients ( n = @ , age @ + / -@ years ) at risk of malnutrition according to the short form of the mini nutritional assessment were randomly allocated to dietary counseling , including liquid and multivitamin supplementation , i.e. intervention ( I , n = @ ) and to controls ( C , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Body weight , biochemical indices ( e.g. insulin-like growth factor I ( IGF-I ) ) , Katz activities of daily living ( ADL ) index , mini mental status examination ( MMSE ) and quality of life ( QoL ) by SF-@ were assessed at the start of the study and after @ months .
METHODS	Statistical analyses were performed on `` intention-to-treat '' and on `` treated-as-protocol '' bases .
RESULTS	Fifty-four patients , @ in the I-group ( @ + / -@ years , @ % females ) and @ in the C-group ( @ + / -@ years , @ % females ) completed the study according to the protocol .
RESULTS	Both modes of analysis revealed a significant positive effect of the combined nutritional intervention on weight maintenance .
RESULTS	Treated-as-protocol analyses showed that Katz ADL index improved in the I-group ( p < @ ; p < @ between the groups ) .
RESULTS	Serum IGF-I levels increased in the I-group ( p < @ ) , but were unchanged in the C-group ( p = @ between the groups ) .
RESULTS	QoL was assessed to be low and had not changed after nutritional treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Combined nutritional intervention prevented weight loss and improved ADL functions in discharged geriatric patients at risk of malnutrition .

BACKGROUND	Mechanistic data suggest that n-@ PUFAs and endothelial function may interact and play a role in carcinogenesis , but epidemiologic evidence is lacking .
OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to investigate whether the prospective association between soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-@ ( sICAM-@ ) and cancer risk is modulated by n-@ PUFA intake .
METHODS	A nested case-control study was designed to include all first-incident cancer cases diagnosed in the SUpplmentation en VItamines et Minraux AntioXydants cohort between @ and @ , with available dietary data from @-h records ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Cases were matched with @ or @ randomly selected controls ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and @ % CIs for the association between prediagnostic plasma concentrations of sICAM-@ and cancer risk , stratified by n-@ PUFA intake .
METHODS	The interactions between sICAM-@ and n-@ PUFA intake were tested .
RESULTS	An interaction was observed between sICAM-@ and n-@ PUFA intake , which was consistent across the studied cancer locations ( P-interaction = @ for overall , @ for breast , and @ for prostate cancer risk ) .
RESULTS	sICAM-@ concentrations were positively associated with cancer risk among subjects with n-@ PUFA intakes below the median ( multivariate OR ( Tertile@vsTertile@ ) : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P-trend = @ ) , whereas this association was not observed for subjects with n-@ PUFA intakes above the median ( OR ( Tertile@vsTertile@ ) : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ; P-trend = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that n-@ PUFA intake may counteract the procarcinogenic actions of sICAM-@ .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness of a computerized , errorless learning-based memory rehabilitation program for Chinese patients with traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) .
METHODS	This study adopted a pre - and post-test quasi-experimental design .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with TBI were randomly assigned to a Computer-Assisted Memory Training Group ( CAMG ) , a Therapist-administered Memory Training Group ( TAMG ) and a Control Group ( CG ) .
METHODS	Except for the CG , the patients in both the CAMG and TAMG groups received , respectively , @-month memory training programmes that were similar in content but differed in delivery mode .
METHODS	All patients were followed up @ month after treatment .
METHODS	The outcome measures that were taken were the Neurobehavioural Cognitive Status Examination ( NCSE or Cognistat ) , the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test ( RBMT ) and The Hong Kong List Learning Test ( HKLLT ) .
METHODS	Repeated measure analyses were performed to investigate differences among the three groups .
RESULTS	The patients in the Computer-assisted Memory Rehabilitation ( CAMG ) and Therapist-administered Memory Rehabilitation group ( TAMG ) were found to perform better than the CG in the NCSE and RBMT , but no significant differences were found between the CAMG and TAMG .
RESULTS	The CAMG showed significant improvement in their HKLLT assessment as compared with the TAMG and CG .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences were found between the CAMG and TAMG when comparing the post-training outcome measures with the follow-up results .
CONCLUSIONS	There is no difference between CAMG and TAMG , but the efficacy has been demonstrated when comparing with CG .
CONCLUSIONS	It is suggested that the combined use of an errorless learning and a computerized approach may be an effective way of enhancing the memories of patients with TBI .
CONCLUSIONS	This new method may smooth the progress of the whole human memory process and produce a better carryover treatment effect .

METHODS	A fourth arm ( no adjuvant treatment ) with @ patients was discontinued in @ .
METHODS	Tumors were classified as ER-negative ( @ % ) , ER-positive ( @ % ) , or ER status unknown ( @ % ) .
METHODS	Twenty percent of patients were aged @ years or younger .
METHODS	The median follow-up was @ years .
METHODS	The primary outcome was disease-free survival ( DFS ) .
RESULTS	Patients with ER-negative tumors achieved better disease-free survival if they received CMF ( @-year DFS for CMF = @ % , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ % to @ % ; @-year DFS for CMF -- > goserelin = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) than if they received goserelin alone ( @-year DFS = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	By contrast , for patients with ER-positive disease , chemotherapy alone and goserelin alone provided similar outcomes ( @-year DFS for both treatment groups = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) , whereas sequential therapy ( @-year DFS = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) provided a statistically nonsignificant improvement compared with either modality alone , primarily because of the results among younger women .
CONCLUSIONS	Premenopausal women with ER-negative ( i.e. , endocrine nonresponsive ) , lymph node-negative breast cancer should receive adjuvant chemotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with ER-positive ( i.e. , endocrine responsive ) disease , the combination of chemotherapy with ovarian function suppression or other endocrine agents , and the use of endocrine therapy alone should be studied .

BACKGROUND	Intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) and plasmapheresis ( plasma exchange ( PLEX ) ) have comparable efficacy in reducing the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score for disease severity ( QMGS ) in patients with moderate to severe myasthenia gravis ( MG ) .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if the improvement in the quality of life ( QOL ) after immunomodulation is comparable with either IVIG or PLEX .
METHODS	@ patients participated in the MG-QOL-@ study , completing the questionnaire at baseline and at day @ after treatment .
METHODS	The MG-QOL-@ scores were computed from the MG-QOL-@ questionnaire responses .
METHODS	We analysed the change in the QOL scores from baseline to day @ in both treatment groups .
RESULTS	The scores in both QOL scales decreased at day @ in the IVIG and PLEX groups , without significant difference between groups ( QOL-@ : IVIG -@ @ , PLEX : -@ @ , p = @ ; QOL-@ : IVIG -@ @ , PLEX -@ @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The improvement in QOL showed a good correlation with the decrease in QMGS .
RESULTS	There was an excellent correlation between the MG-QOL-@ and MG-QOL-@ scores at baseline and at day @ .
CONCLUSIONS	This study of MG-QOL changes supports recent findings that IVIG and PLEX are comparable in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe MG and worsening symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , our study supports the use of the MG-QOL-@ as a secondary outcome measure in future clinical trials in MG .

BACKGROUND	Several antibacterial agents have been studied as a means to produce bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity as an adjunct to mechanical treatment of periodontal disease .
BACKGROUND	The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of tetracycline strips administered singly or in multiples in conjunction with root planing , versus root planing alone , or to an untreated control .
BACKGROUND	Secondary purposes were to compare gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) volume and GCF concentrations of tetracycline in pockets treated with strips ; to evaluate strip insertion time ; and to compare ease of placement for single or multiple strips .
METHODS	Using a @-quadrant design , @ test teeth in @ patients were treated with either root planing and single strip application ; root planing and multiple strip application ; root planing alone ; or an untreated control .
RESULTS	Single and multiple strip placement resulted in a significant reduction in probing depth ( P = @ ) compared to root planing and untreated groups .
RESULTS	The multiple strip group significantly decreased bleeding on probing ( P = @ ) compared to all other treatment groups .
RESULTS	There was no treatment effect on GCF ; however , there was a significant reduction in the GCF volume over time ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The time required for placement was , on average , @ minutes for single strips and @ minutes for multiple strips .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggest that multiple strips are superior to a single strip in reducing bleeding on probing , and that local delivery of tetracycline is superior to root planing alone in reducing probing depth .

BACKGROUND	Airway suctioning in mechanically ventilated patients is required to maintain airway patency .
BACKGROUND	Closed suction catheters ( CSCs ) minimize lung volume loss during suctioning but require cleaning post-suction .
BACKGROUND	Despite their widespread use , there is no published evidence examining lung volumes during CSC cleaning .
BACKGROUND	The study objectives were to quantify lung volume changes during CSC cleaning and to determine whether these changes were preventable using a CSC with a valve in situ between the airway and catheter cleaning chamber .
METHODS	This prospective randomized crossover study was conducted in a metropolitan tertiary ICU .
METHODS	Ten patients mechanically ventilated via volume-controlled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation ( SIMV-VC ) and requiring manual hyperinflation ( MHI ) were included in this study .
METHODS	CSC cleaning was performed using @ different brands of CSC ( one with a valve [ Ballard Trach Care @ , Kimberly-Clark , Roswell , Georgia ] and one without [ Portex Steri-Cath DL , Smiths Medical , Dublin , Ohio ] ) .
METHODS	The maneuvers were performed during both SIMV-VC and MHI .
METHODS	Lung volume change was measured via impedance change using electrical impedance tomography .
METHODS	A mixed model was used to compare the estimated means .
RESULTS	During cleaning of the valveless CSC , significant decreases in lung impedance occurred during MHI ( -@ impedance units , @ % CI @-@ , P < @ ) , and significant increases in lung impedance occurred during SIMV ( @ impedance units , @ % CI @-@ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , cleaning of the CSC with a valve in situ resulted in non-significant lung volume changes and maintenance of normal ventilation during MHI and SIMV-VC , respectively ( @ impedance units , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ; and @ impedance units , @ % CI -@ to @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When there is no valve between the airway and suction catheter , cleaning of the CSC results in significant derangements in lung volume .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the presence of such a valve should be considered essential in preserving lung volumes and uninterrupted ventilation in mechanically ventilated patients .

BACKGROUND	Generalised recalcitrant facial verruca plana responds poorly to current therapeutic options , including cryotherapy , topical drugs and carbon dioxide ( CO@ ) laser .
BACKGROUND	Case reports and uncontrolled studies suggested that topical photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) is effective choice of treatment free from potential complications associated with invasive therapies .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy and safety of PDT with different concentrations of photosensitiser in the treatment of verruca plana .
METHODS	The two sides of a subject 's face were separately randomized to receive aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) of @ % , @ % or @ % concentration .
METHODS	All patients were irradiated with @-nm red light for @ J/cm ( @ ) total dose .
METHODS	Complete response ( CR ) rate was assessed on Week @ , @ , and @ respectively .
RESULTS	The mean overall clearance rate was @ % , @ % , and @ % on Week @ , @ , and @ , respectively , in the @ treated sides .
RESULTS	The CR rate was lower in the @ % - ALA group than in the @ % - ALA group ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) and @ % - ALA group ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ) after @ weeks .
RESULTS	The mean severity of pain measured by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) scoring was @ ( range : @ to @ , depending on the lesion location ) .
RESULTS	The overall recurrence rate was @ % ( @/@ ) on Week @ .
RESULTS	Hyperpigmentation was observed in @ % ( @/@ ) of all treated sides .
RESULTS	On Week @ , @ , and @ , hyperpigmentation was more developed in the @ % - ALA group than in the other two groups ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In terms of complete clearance rate , the @ % ALA-PDT group was significantly inferior to the @ % and @ % ALA-PDT groups at each follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , the @ % ALA group showed a higher incidence rate of transient hyperpigmentation than the other two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This randomised clinical trial suggests that PDT with ALA of @ % concentration offers better efficacy and safety than @ % or @ % concentration for generalised recalcitrant facial verruca plana .

BACKGROUND	Cerebrovascular accidents ( CVAs ) , transient ischemic attacks ( TIAs ) , and peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) frequently coexist with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and were previously reported to adversely affect the prognosis of patients with chronic CAD .
METHODS	We examined the effect of prior CVA/TIA or PAD ( extra-cardiac vascular disease [ EVD ] ) on the outcome of @,@ patients with acute coronary syndromes enrolled in the Orbofiban in Patients with Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( OPUS-TIMI ) @ trial of the oral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist orbofiban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone .
METHODS	We evaluated mortality , recurrent cardiac events , and stroke and used multivariate analysis to control for differences in baseline characteristics .
RESULTS	Patients with EVD were older , had more coronary risk factors , had a history of CAD , and received more intensive medical treatment at baseline .
RESULTS	The acute event in these patients was more often unstable angina pectoris and less commonly Q-wave myocardial infarction .
RESULTS	With coronary angiography , patients with prior EVD more often had multivessel disease .
RESULTS	During the @ months of follow-up , the presence of EVD was predictive of an increased hazard of death , reinfarction , recurrent ischemia , stroke , and a composite of these events .
RESULTS	Despite the increased severity of the CAD and increased risk of events , patients with EVD were treated less frequently with beta-blockers and more frequently with calcium blockers .
RESULTS	Despite patients with EVD having a @ % higher incidence of hypercholesterolemia , lipid-lowering agents were prescribed in a similar percentage of patients as patients without EVD .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with acute coronary syndromes , the presence of prior CVA , TIA , or PAD is associated with more extensive CAD and worse outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	These patients appear to receive less aggressive treatment , which may explain , at least in part , their worse outcome .

BACKGROUND	In spite of several studies , the impact of homocysteine level and folic acid supplementation on bone metabolism is yet to be recognized .
BACKGROUND	In this registered clinical trial ( IRCT@N@ ) , we aimed to find out the power of @-month folic acid supplementation on homocysteine level and bone metabolism .
METHODS	Forty postmenopausal osteoporotic women ( @ to @years ) were enrolled in the study .
METHODS	All participants were randomized to receive folic acid @mg ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	At baseline , @months , and finally @months post intervention , the level of homocysteine , vitamin B@ , and bone biomarkers were measured .
RESULTS	Both groups were similar at baseline .
RESULTS	The homocysteine decreased in both groups but statistically non-significant ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The changes of the serum level of vitamin B@ , osteocalcin , and cross laps were significant between groups after @months ( P@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The trend of changes of bone biomarkers after @months folic acid supplementation shows that homocysteine concentration and/or folic acid supplementation have impact on the rate of bone metabolism .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further investigations by larger sample size and differentiating age and gender are still needed to clarify the exact role of folate , homocysteine and vitamin B@ .

BACKGROUND	Resistant starch may modulate insulin sensitivity , although the precise mechanism of this action is unknown .
OBJECTIVE	We studied the effects of resistant starch on insulin sensitivity and tissue metabolism .
METHODS	We used a @-wk supplementation period with @ g resistant starch/d , compared with placebo , in @ healthy subjects and assessed the results by using arteriovenous difference methods .
RESULTS	When assessed by euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp , insulin sensitivity was higher after resistant starch supplementation than after placebo treatment ( @ and @ x @ ( -@ ) mg glucose x kg ( -@ ) x min ( -@ ) x ( mU insulin/L ) ( -@ ) , respectively ; P = @ ) ; insulin sensitivity during the meal tolerance test ( MTT ) was @ % higher ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Forearm muscle glucose clearance during the MTT was also higher after resistant starch supplementation ( P = @ ) despite lower insulin concentrations ( P = @ ) ; glucose clearance adjusted for insulin was @ % higher .
RESULTS	Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue nonesterified fatty acid ( NEFA ; P = @ ) and glycerol ( P = @ ) release were lower with resistant starch supplementation , although systemic NEFA concentrations were not significantly altered .
RESULTS	Short-chain fatty acid concentrations ( acetate and propionate ) were higher during the MTT ( P = @ and @ , respectively ) , as was acetate uptake by adipose tissue ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fasting plasma ghrelin concentrations were higher with resistant starch supplementation ( @ compared with @ pg/mL ; P = @ ) , although postprandial suppression ( @-@ % ) did not differ significantly .
RESULTS	Measurements of gene expression in adipose tissue and muscle were uninformative , which suggests effects at a metabolic level .
RESULTS	The resistant starch supplement was well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that dietary supplementation with resistant starch has the potential to improve insulin sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies in insulin-resistant persons are needed .

OBJECTIVE	Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy and side effects of danazol @ mg daily given only in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle to treat premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual mastalgia .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study of @ menstrual cycles in a postgraduate medical school and National Health Service hospital .
METHODS	The subjects of the study were @ women who had been referred to the premenstrual syndrome clinic at the North Staffordshire Hospital for the management of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual breast pain .
METHODS	Outcome measures for the study included assessment of improvement in symptoms measured by specific daily visual analogue scales for @ principal symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and for premenstrual mastalgia and assessment of side effects and adverse events .
RESULTS	Significant improvement in symptoms was seen in visual analog scores for mastalgia in months @ ( P = @ ) , @ ( P = @ ) , and @ ( P = @ ) of the study during active therapy compared with placebo .
RESULTS	No improvement was seen for any other symptom or for the global premenstrual syndrome score .
RESULTS	Side effects on danazol and on placebo were equal and minimal .
CONCLUSIONS	Luteal phase-only danazol is not effective for the treatment of the general symptoms of premenstrual syndrome but appears highly effective for the relief of premenstrual mastalgia .
CONCLUSIONS	This approach to therapy is associated with few side effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies of cyclic mastalgia using strict diagnostic criteria are required to see whether the freedom from symptomatic side effects is found in longer-term studies and to determine whether such a regimen avoids potentially detrimental effects on the lipid status .

CONCLUSIONS	Under intense monitoring , adjusted-dose warfarin ( INR @ - @ ) is effective and safe for the moderate to high risk nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients .

###16687205
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of darifenacin controlled-release ( CR ) and oxybutynin extended-release ( ER ) on cognitive function ( particularly memory ) in older subjects .
METHODS	Healthy subjects ( n = @ ) > / = @ years were randomised to darifenacin , oxybutynin ER or placebo in a multicentre , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group , @-week study .
METHODS	Doses were administered according to US labels : oxybutynin ER @mg once daily ( od ) , increasing to @mg od then @mg od by week @ ; darifenacin @ mg od in weeks @ and @ , then @mg od in week @ .
METHODS	The primary end point was accuracy on the Name-Face Association Test ( delayed recall ) at week @ .
RESULTS	Results of the Name-Face Association Test at week @ showed no significant difference between darifenacin and placebo on delayed recall ( mean difference , -@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In contrast , oxybutynin ER resulted in memory impairment , with significantly lower scores than placebo and darifenacin ( mean differences , -@ , p = @ and -@ , p = @ , respectively ) for delayed recall on the Name-Face Association Test at week @ .
RESULTS	Additional tests of delayed recall indicated significant memory impairment with oxybutynin ER versus placebo at certain time points , whereas darifenacin was similar to placebo .
RESULTS	No between-treatment differences were detected in self-rated memory , demonstrating that subjects were unaware of memory deterioration .
CONCLUSIONS	While darifenacin had no significant effects on memory versus placebo , oxybutynin ER caused significant memory deterioration ( magnitude of effect comparable to brain aging of @ years ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results also demonstrate that subjects may not recognise/report memory deterioration .

BACKGROUND	The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome .
BACKGROUND	No study , however , has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic .
METHODS	Of @ @ hypertensive patients ( aged @-@ years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors ) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial , @,@ with nonfasting total cholesterol concentrations @ mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin @ mg or placebo .
METHODS	These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study .
METHODS	We planned follow-up for an average of @ years , the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD .
METHODS	Data were analysed by intention to treat .
RESULTS	Treatment was stopped after a median follow-up of @ years .
RESULTS	By that time , @ primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with @ events in the placebo group ( hazard ratio @ [ @ % CI @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up .
RESULTS	There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups .
RESULTS	Fatal and non-fatal stroke ( @ atorvastatin vs @ placebo , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) , total cardiovascular events ( @ vs @ , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) , and total coronary events ( @ vs @ , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) were also significantly lowered .
RESULTS	There were @ deaths in the atorvastatin group and @ in the placebo group ( @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about @ mmol/L compared with placebo at @ months , and by @ mmol/L after @ years of follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	The reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large , given the short follow-up time .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether depot leuprolide is effective in premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ) and whether symptom type or severity affects therapeutic or hormonal responses and the incidence of adverse events .
METHODS	Twenty-five women who met strict diagnostic criteria for PMS completed a double-blind , placebo-controlled , @-month crossover trial at a university medical center .
METHODS	Depot leuprolide ( @ mg/month ) or saline was administered intramuscularly for three consecutive treatment cycles .
METHODS	Efficacy , adverse events , and hormone concentrations were assessed at each visit .
METHODS	Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze continuous data , and ordinal and binary data were analyzed using nonparametric techniques .
RESULTS	Depot leuprolide treatment was significantly more effective than placebo on all rating scales .
RESULTS	Irritability , neurologic symptoms , breast tenderness , and fatigue were most responsive to treatment .
RESULTS	Symptoms were reduced to follicular phase levels only in women without premenstrual depression .
RESULTS	Those with moderate premenstrual depression improved but remained clinically symptomatic , whereas the group with severe premenstrual depression showed no improvement on any efficacy measure .
RESULTS	Adverse events were lowest in those without premenstrual depression and highest in those with severe depression .
RESULTS	Leuprolide suppressed estradiol and progesterone in most premenstrual depression groups but had varying effects on gonadotropins .
CONCLUSIONS	Leuprolide treatment reduced both behavioral and physical symptoms and was well tolerated in the absence of severe premenstrual depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Women should be evaluated for depression severity before receiving a GnRH agonist .
CONCLUSIONS	The differential response to leuprolide suggests that it may possess diagnostic value in determining distinct subtypes of PMS .

BACKGROUND	Although pulse oximetry is currently in widespread use , there are few data documenting improvement in patient outcome as a result of the use of oximetry .
BACKGROUND	The authors describe the study design , patient demographic findings , data validation , pulse oximetry failure rate , and overall postoperative complication rates in the first large prospective randomized multicenter clinical trial on perioperative pulse oximetry monitoring .
METHODS	In five Danish hospitals , by random assignment , monitoring did or did not include pulse oximetry for patients @ yr of age and older , whether scheduled for elective or emergency operations , or for regional or general anesthesia , except during cardiac and neurosurgical procedures .
METHODS	Operational definitions were established for perioperative events and postoperative complications .
METHODS	The data were collected preoperatively , during anesthesia , in the postanesthesia care unit , and until the day of discharge from the hospital or the seventh postoperative day .
RESULTS	Of @,@ patients , @,@ were assigned to the oximetry group and @,@ , to the control group .
RESULTS	In general , the demographic data , patient factors , and anesthetic agents used were distributed evenly .
RESULTS	A slight intergroup difference was found in the distribution of age , duration of surgery , some types of surgery , and some types of anesthesia .
RESULTS	The total failure rate of the oximetry was @ % , but it increased to @ % in patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status @ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In @ % of the patients , one or more events occurred in the operating room and @ % in the postanesthesia care unit .
RESULTS	The overall postoperative complication rate was @ % .
RESULTS	The total rates of cardiovascular and respiratory complications were @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Within the first seven postoperative days , @ % of the patients died .
RESULTS	Anesthesia was not thought to have been solely responsible for any death , but in @ patients ( @ per @,@ ) , it was a possible contributory factor .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite the finding of a few significant inter-group differences , the randomization was well balanced with a high validity of data .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall postoperative complication rate was similar to that in other recent morbidity and mortality studies .

BACKGROUND	Physical examination is a crucial part in medical student curricula , but a decline in physical examination skills was noted in the last two decades .
BACKGROUND	The benefic role of ultrasonography ( US ) as an adjuvant method for clinical examination was evaluated in many studies , but there are different approaches among countries and universities .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of US in learning physical exam in @rd year medical students .
METHODS	One hundred and four @rd year medical students were randomly enrolled .
METHODS	They were divided first in two equal groups ( I and II , with and without US , by rotation ) and then in smaller groups of @-@ students .
METHODS	Pairs between smaller groups belonging to group I and II were randomly established in order to be trained and evaluated by the same instructor .
METHODS	We verified the influence of US on the correctness of thyroid palpation , lung percussion ( inferior limit of the lung ) , and liver size estimation .
METHODS	They received no special training on US .
METHODS	After the learning sessions ( four sessions , one hour each ) a questionnaire was applied to each student .
RESULTS	For thyroid palpation , there were no significant differences regarding the gland dimensions .
RESULTS	For lung and liver palpation the results showed better results for some points in groups using US as adjuvant , but the most significant difference regarded the appreciation of self confidence ( in favor of US-groups ) .
RESULTS	The majority of the students using US appreciated as very useful the informations provided by US .
RESULTS	Also , we found a clear improvement in detecting the upper limit of the liver comparing with the inferior limit of the lung , as result of better clinical skills .
CONCLUSIONS	The results from this pilot study proved the utility of US in learning clinical examination .
CONCLUSIONS	The students can better understand the regional anatomy and can confirm immediately the physical findings .
CONCLUSIONS	It is important for students to reach a certain level of knowledge regarding physical exam to better understand the role of US .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , we can state that use of US in the daily clinical examination teaching greatly improved the students ' clinical examination abilities and that is a strong argument for integrating basic US into the medical school curriculum .

BACKGROUND	Topical application of nicotine and stimulation of tachykinin containing sensory nerves have been shown to produce mucosal exudation of plasma and derangement of the epithelial lining in guinea pig and rat airways .
BACKGROUND	If this occurred in man these effects might contribute to the pathogenesis of airway disease .
BACKGROUND	This study , performed in healthy volunteers without atopy , examined whether nicotine affects the plasma exudation response and the mucosal absorption permeability of the human nasal airway .
METHODS	The acute effects of increasing topical doses of nicotine ( @-@ @ mg ) were examined ( n = @ ) on nasal symptoms ( pain ) , mucosal exudation of plasma ( albumin ) , mucosal secretion of mucin ( fucose ) , and mucosal exudative responsiveness ( histamine induced mucosal exudation of albumin ) .
METHODS	A separate placebo controlled study was carried out to determine whether frequent applications of the high dose of nicotine ( @ mg given eight times daily for nine days ) had any deleterious effects on the airway mucosa detectable as altered responses to histamine challenge .
METHODS	Both mucosal exudation of plasma ( n = @ ) and mucosal absorption of chromium-@ labelled EDTA ( n = @ ) were thus examined in nasal airways exposed to both nicotine and histamine .
RESULTS	Nicotine caused nasal pain and produced dose dependent mucosal secretion of fucose but failed to produce any mucosal exudation of albumin .
RESULTS	The exudative responsiveness to histamine was , indeed , decreased when the challenge was performed immediately after administration of acute doses of nicotine , whereas the responsiveness was unaffected when histamine challenges were carried out during prolonged treatment with nicotine .
RESULTS	The nasal mucosal absorption of @Cr-EDTA in the presence of histamine did not differ between subjects receiving either placebo or nicotine treatment for nine days .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that nicotine applied to the human airway mucosa produces pain and secretion of mucin , but inflammatory changes such as mucosal exudation of plasma and epithelial disruption may not be produced .
CONCLUSIONS	Neurogenic inflammatory responses , which are so readily produced in guinea pig and rat airways , may not occur in human airways .

BACKGROUND	The risk of persistent tardive dyskinesia ( TD ) was compared in patients with acute psychosis or agitation aged @ years or older who were treated with olanzapine ( OLZ ) or conventional antipsychotic ( CNV ) drug therapy .
METHODS	Patients without TD were randomized to treatment with OLZ ( @-@ mg/d ; n = @ ) or CNV ( dosed per label ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	Following a @-week drug tapering/initiation period , patients without TD were treated with OLZ or CNV for up to @ year .
METHODS	The a priori defined primary outcome end point was persistent TD defined as Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) scores = @ on at least @ items or @ on at least @ item ( items @-@ ) lasting at least for @ month ( Criterion A ) .
METHODS	Post hoc analyses assessed persistent TD meeting the criterion of moderate severity defined as AIMS score @ on at least @ item persisting for @ month ( Criterion B ) and probable TD defined as elevated AIMS scores ( Criterion A or B ) not persisting for @ month .
METHODS	Treatment groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank exact test .
RESULTS	On average , patients were @ years of age ; the predominant diagnosis was dementia ( @ % in the OLZ group and @ % in the CNV group ) .
RESULTS	Approximately , @ % of patients in the CNV group received haloperidol .
RESULTS	No significant difference in time to developing persistent TD was observed during treatment with OLZ or CNV ( cumulative incidence : OLZ , @ % [ @ % confidence interval [ @ % CI ] : @-@ @ ] ; CNV , @ % [ @ % CI : @-@ @ ] , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The exposure-adjusted event rates per @ person-years were not significantly different between treatment groups : OLZ ( @ ) and CNV ( @ ; ratio : @ ; @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Post hoc analyses revealed a significantly lower risk of at least moderately severe persistent TD persisting for @ month ( P = @ ) and probable TD not persisting for @ month ( Criterion A , P = @ ; Criterion B , P = @ ) in OLZ-treated patients .
RESULTS	For those patients without significant extrapyramidal symptoms at baseline , significantly more patients in the CNV treatment group developed treatment-emergent parkinsonism than for patients in the OLZ treatment group ( CNV : @ % , @ of @ patients ; OLZ @ % , @ of @ patients ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference between the groups was observed for treatment-emergent akathisia ( CNV : @ % , @ of @ patients ; OLZ : @ % , @ of @ patients ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The cumulative incidence of persistent TD was low and the risk of persistent TD did not differ significantly among predominantly older adult patients having dementia with acute psychosis or agitation treated with OLZ or CNV .

BACKGROUND	Work-related stress is associated with a variety of mental and emotional problems and can lead to substantial economic costs due to lost productivity , absenteeism or the inability to work .
BACKGROUND	There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees ; however , they are often costly , time-consuming , and characterized by a high access threshold .
BACKGROUND	Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce .
BACKGROUND	This paper describes the protocol for a study that will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided stress-management training which is based on problem solving and emotion regulation and aimed at reducing stress in adult employees .
METHODS	The study will target stressed employees aged @ and older .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) design will be applied .
METHODS	Based on a power calculation of d = @ ( @ - of @ % , = @ ) , @ participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group .
METHODS	Inclusion criteria include an elevated stress level ( Cohen 's Perceived Stress Scale-@ @ ) and current employment .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria include risk of suicide or previously diagnosed psychosis or dissociative symptoms .
METHODS	The primary outcome will be perceived stress , and secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety .
METHODS	Data will be collected at baseline and seven weeks and six months after randomization .
METHODS	An extended follow up at @ months is planned for the intervention group .
METHODS	Moreover , a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect health care costs .
METHODS	Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol .
CONCLUSIONS	The substantial negative consequences of work-related stress emphasize the necessity for effective stress-management trainings .
CONCLUSIONS	If the proposed internet intervention proves to be ( cost - ) effective , a preventative , economical stress-management tool will be conceivable .
CONCLUSIONS	The strengths and limitations of the present study are discussed .

BACKGROUND	The aging process involves a decline in immune functioning that renders elderly people more vulnerable to disease .
BACKGROUND	In residential programs for the aged , it is vital to diminish their risk of disease , promote their independence , and augment their psychological well-being and quality of life .
METHODS	We performed a randomized controlled study , evaluating the ability of a relaxation technique based on Benson 's relaxation response to enhance psychological well-being and modulate the immune parameters of elderly people living in a geriatric residence when compared to a waitlist control group .
METHODS	The study included a @-week intervention period and a @-month follow-up period .
METHODS	The main outcome variables were psychological well-being and quality of life , biomedical variables , immune changes from the pre-treatment to post-treatment and follow-up periods .
RESULTS	Our findings reveal significant differences between the experimental and control groups in CD@ , CD@ , CD@ , CD@ , and CD@ lymphocyte subpopulations at the end of treatment .
RESULTS	Furthermore , there was a decrease in negative affect , psychological discomfort , and symptom perception in the treatment group , which increased participants ' quality of life scores at the three-month follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	This study represents a first approach to the application of a passive relaxation technique in residential programs for the elderly .
CONCLUSIONS	The method appears to be effective in enhancing psychological well-being and modulating immune activity in a group of elderly people .
CONCLUSIONS	This relaxation technique could be considered an option for achieving health benefits with a low cost for residential programs , but further studies using this technique in larger samples of older people are needed to confirm the trends observed in the present study .

OBJECTIVE	In cardiac surgery , the choice of temperature regimen during cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) remains a subject of debate .
OBJECTIVE	Hypothermia reduces tissue metabolic demands , but may impair the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and contribute to neurological morbidity .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two different temperature regimens during CPB on the systemic oxygen transport and the cerebral oxygenation during surgical correction of acquired heart diseases .
METHODS	In a prospective study , we randomized @ adult patients with combined valvular disorders requiring surgical correction of two or more valves into two groups : ( i ) a normothermic ( NMTH ) group ( n = @ ) , in which the body core temperature was maintained at @ C during CPB and ( ii ) a hypothermic ( HPTH ) group ( n = @ ) , in which the body was cooled to a core temperature of @C maintained throughout the period of CPB .
METHODS	The systemic oxygen transport and the cerebral oxygen saturation ( SctO@ ) were assessed by means of a PiCCO@ haemodynamic monitor and a cerebral oximeter , respectively .
METHODS	All the patients received standard perioperative monitoring .
METHODS	We assessed haemodynamic and oxygen transport parameters , the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of the ICU and the hospital stays .
RESULTS	During CPB , central venous oxygen saturation was significantly higher in the HPTH group but SctO@ was increased in the NMTH group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Cardiac index , systemic oxygen delivery and consumption increased postoperatively in both groups .
RESULTS	However , oxygen delivery and consumption were significantly higher in the NMTH group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The duration of respiratory support and the length of ICU and hospital stays did not differ between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	During combined valve surgery , normothermic CPB provides lower central venous oxygen saturation , but increases cerebral tissue oxygenation when compared with the hypothermic regimen .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to compare the efficiency of low dose vs. varying doses of hyperbaric bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia for endoscopic urological procedures .
METHODS	Sixty consecutive patients were studied in a randomized prospective manner .
METHODS	They received either of @ ( Gr I ) , @ ( Gr II ) or @ mg ( Gr III ) of hyperbaric bupivacaine @ % combined with @ microg of fentanyl , through a @-gauge W hitacre spinal needle placed in the L@-L@ interspace .
METHODS	Characteristics of sensory and motor block , dose of ephedrine required , secondary effects , the patients , and the surgeons satisfaction , were noted .
RESULTS	The maximum number of blocked segments was @ + / - @ ( Gr I ) , @ + / - @ ( Gr II ) and @ + / - @ ( Gr III ) .
RESULTS	Time to T@ regression was significantly shorter for Gr I ( @ + / - @ min ) than for Gr II ( @ + / - @ min ) or Gr III ( @ + / - @ min ) .
RESULTS	Bromage @ block was not found in Gr I compared to @ patients in Gr II and @ patients in Gr III .
RESULTS	The duration of motor block was shorter in Gr @ ( @ + / - @ min ) than in Gr II ( @ + / - @ min ) and in Gr III ( @ + / - @ min ) .
RESULTS	Ephedrine was used for @ patients in Gr III ( @ + / - @ mg ) , @ patients in Gr II ( @ + / - @ mg ) and @ patients in Gr I ( @ + / - @ mg ) .
RESULTS	The difference is statistically significant between Gr III and the other groups .
CONCLUSIONS	These results suggest that the use of a low dose of bupivacaine ( @ mg ) added to fentanyl ( @ microg ) for endoscopic urological surgery , resulted in short-acting sensory block , without motor block and a lower incidence of cardiovascular side effects , as compared to either of @ or @ mg bupivacaine with @ microg fentanyl .

BACKGROUND	Helminth infection is common in malaria endemic areas , and an interaction between the two would be of considerable public health importance .
BACKGROUND	Animal models suggest that helminth infections may increase susceptibility to malaria , but epidemiological data has been limited and contradictory .
RESULTS	In a vaccine trial , we studied @ one - to six-year-old children for the effect of helminth infections on febrile Plasmodium falciparum malaria episodes .
RESULTS	Gastrointestinal helminth infection and eosinophilia were prevalent ( @ % and @ % respectively ) , but did not influence susceptibility to malaria .
RESULTS	Hazard ratios were @ for gastrointestinal helminth infection ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) and @ and @ for mild and marked eosinophilia , respectively ( @ % CI @-@ @ and @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Incident rate ratios for multiple episodes were @ for gastro-intestinal helminth infection ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) and @ and @ for mild and marked eosinophilia ( @ % CI @-@ @ and @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence that infection with gastrointestinal helminths or urinary schistosomiasis increased susceptibility to Plasmodium falciparum malaria in this study .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger studies including populations with a greater prevalence of helminth infection should be undertaken .

BACKGROUND	Epidemiologic and experimental data have suggested that chlorogenic acid , which is a polyphenol contained in green coffee beans , prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance .
OBJECTIVE	We assessed whether the consumption of chlorogenic acid-rich coffee attenuates the effects of short-term fructose overfeeding , dietary conditions known to increase intrahepatocellular lipids ( IHCLs ) , and blood triglyceride concentrations and to decrease hepatic insulin sensitivity in healthy humans .
METHODS	Effects of @ different coffees were assessed in @ healthy volunteers in a randomized , controlled , crossover trial .
METHODS	IHCLs , hepatic glucose production ( HGP ) ( by @,@-d@ glucose dilution ) , and fasting lipid oxidation were measured after @ d of consumption of caffeinated coffee high in chlorogenic acid ( C-HCA ) , decaffeinated coffee high in chlorogenic acid , or decaffeinated coffee with regular amounts of chlorogenic acid ( D-RCA ) ; during the last @ d of the study , the weight-maintenance diet of subjects was supplemented with @ g fructose kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ( total energy intake SD : @ @ % of weight-maintenance requirements ) .
METHODS	All participants were also studied without coffee supplementation , either with @ g fructose kg ( -@ ) d ( -@ ) ( high fructose only ) or without high fructose ( control ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the control diet , the high-fructose diet significantly increased IHCLs by @ @ % and HGP by @ @ % and decreased fasting lipid oxidation by @ @ % ( all P < @ ) .
RESULTS	All @ coffees significantly decreased HGP .
RESULTS	Fasting lipid oxidation increased with C-HCA and D-RCA ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	None of the @ coffees significantly altered IHCLs .
CONCLUSIONS	Coffee consumption attenuates hepatic insulin resistance but not the increase of IHCLs induced by fructose overfeeding .
CONCLUSIONS	This effect does not appear to be mediated by differences in the caffeine or chlorogenic acid content .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Several studies have indicated that water infusion , instead of air insufflation , enhances cecal intubation in selected patients undergoing unsedated colonoscopy .
OBJECTIVE	We performed a prospective , randomized , controlled trial to investigate whether the water technique increases the proportion of patients that are able to complete unsedated colonoscopy .
METHODS	We analyzed data from @ consecutive outpatients who were willing to start colonoscopy without sedation ; @ were each randomly assigned to groups given water infusion or air insufflation during the insertion phase .
METHODS	Sedation and analgesia were administered on demand .
RESULTS	Fewer patients requested sedation in the water group ( @ % ) than in the air group ( @ % ; P = @ ) and their maximum pain scores were lower ( @ @ vs @ @ in the air group ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , differences in percentages of patients who received complete , unsedated colonoscopy between the water group ( @ % ) and air group ( @ % ) did not reach statistical significance ( P = @ ) ; the percentage of successful cecal intubations was lower in the water group ( @ % ) than in the air group ( @ % ; P = @ ) because of poor visibility .
RESULTS	Failed procedures in the water group were completed successfully after air insufflation .
RESULTS	The cecal intubation time was shorter in the air group ( @ @ min ) than in the water group ( @ @ min ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients willing to undergo unsedated colonoscopy , water infusion improves patient tolerance for cecal intubation , compared with air insufflation .
CONCLUSIONS	However , it does not increase the overall percentage of successful cecal intubations because suboptimal bowel preparation interferes with visibility .

OBJECTIVE	To ascertain whether simple dietary advice to increase the consumption of Mediterranean foods , given in a clinical setting , leads to reduced mortality after a myocardial infarction .
METHODS	Data were used from the GISSI-Prevenzione clinical trial , analysed as a cohort study with adjustment for treatment allocation .
METHODS	A total of @ centres in Italy .
METHODS	A total of @ men and women with myocardial infarction .
METHODS	All subjects received advice to increase their consumption of fish , fruit , raw and cooked vegetables and olive oil .
METHODS	The intakes of the five foods were assessed at baseline , @ , @ and @ months .
METHODS	Associations of food intakes , a combined dietary score , and the risk of death over @ y were estimated adjusting for several non-dietary variables , using pooled logistic regression .
RESULTS	Subjects generally improved their diet according to the advice given .
RESULTS	All foods were associated with a significant reduction in risk of death .
RESULTS	Compared with people in the worst dietary score quarter , the odds ratio for those in the best score quarter was @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	A good diet had a protective effect in sub-groups defined by age , sex , smoking , randomized treatment and concomitant drug therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Myocardial infarction patients can respond positively to simple dietary advice , and this can be expected to lead to a substantial reduction in the risk of early death .
CONCLUSIONS	Regardless of any drug treatment prescribed , clinicians should routinely advise patients with myocardial infarction to increase their frequency of consumption of Mediterranean foods .

BACKGROUND	Some of the health advantages of breast-fed as compared to formula-fed infants have been suggested to be due to metabolic programming effects resulting from early nutrition .
METHODS	In a prospective double-blinded randomized trial , @ infants < @ mo of age were randomized to experimental formula ( EF ) with added milk fat globule membrane ( MFGM ) or standard formula ( SF ) until @ mo of age .
METHODS	A breast-fed reference ( BFR ) group consisted of @ infants .
METHODS	Measurements were made at inclusion and at @ , @ , and @ mo of age .
RESULTS	During the intervention , the EF group had higher total serum cholesterol concentration than the SF group , reaching the level of the BFR group .
RESULTS	The EF group had a low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio not significantly different from the SF group but lower than the BFR group .
CONCLUSIONS	Supplementation of infant formula with MFGM modified the fat composition of the formula and narrowed the gap between breast-fed and formula-fed infants with regard to serum lipid status at @ mo. .

BACKGROUND	Informed consent is a phrase often used in the law to indicate that the consent a person gives meets certain minimum standards .
BACKGROUND	It relies on patients ' ability to understand risk information .
BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that people may extract the gist of any risk information to make medical decisions .
BACKGROUND	Existing evidence also suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the perception of risk and the perception of benefit .
BACKGROUND	Informed consent is the method by which fully informed , rational persons may be involved in choices about their health care .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to study how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otolaryngologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention , the addition of an information handout , improves their recall .
METHODS	This was a prospective study carried out between January and December @ in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology , University of Ilorin teaching hospital .
METHODS	Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otorhinolaryngologic procedures , including mastoidectomy , tympanoplasty , nasal polypectomy , rhinotomy , maxillectomy , and laryngoscopy , were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and adverse effects .
METHODS	Three surgeons participated in the study .
METHODS	Patients were stratified into @ groups : a higher education group and a lower education group .
METHODS	Within each group , patients were randomized to either a control group , consisting of a verbal explanation only , or an intervention group , which added a written handout to the verbal explanation .
METHODS	A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of @ days ( range , @-@ days ) to survey for recall of the complications discussed .
METHODS	The main outcome measure is risk recall .
METHODS	This was analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention .
METHODS	Other parameters examined were patient demographics and time elapsed from when the consent was obtained .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients involved in the study , @ were men and @ were women , with male/female ratio of @:@ .
RESULTS	The average age was @ years ( range , @-@ years ) .
RESULTS	With respect to educational status , @ patients had the equivalent of high school or less ( group @ ) , and @ had some degree of postsecondary training ( group @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall recall of potential complications was @ % .
RESULTS	Those who received the handout recalled @ % of the complications overall , whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered @ % of the complications .
RESULTS	The difference was significant recall of the specific risks varied considerably .
RESULTS	For those with potential risk of facial nerve paralysis , @ % of them recalled , which was the highest in the study .
RESULTS	This was followed by hearing loss ( @ % ) and nasal adhesion ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The least were anesthetic reactions ( @ % ) and hoarseness ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Those who received the handout recalled @ % of the complications overall , whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered @ % the complications .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of a handout significantly alters recall of potential complications of otorhinolaryngologic surgery with the recall of specific risk highest for facial nerve paralysis .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to study whether there is a difference in benefit of fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) guidance for percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) in multivessel coronary disease in patients with unstable angina ( UA ) or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( NSTEMI ) , compared with stable angina ( SA ) .
BACKGROUND	The use of FFR to guide PCI has been well established for patients with SA .
BACKGROUND	Its use in patients with UA or NSTEMI has not been investigated prospectively .
METHODS	In the FAME ( Fractional flow reserve versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation ) study @,@ patients with multivessel disease amenable to PCI were included and randomized to either angiography-guided PCI of all lesions @ % or FFR-guided PCI of lesions with an FFR @ .
METHODS	Patients admitted for UA or NSTEMI with positive troponin but total creatine kinase < @,@ U/l were eligible for inclusion .
METHODS	We determined @-year major adverse cardiac event rates of these patients and compared it with stable patients .
RESULTS	Of @,@ patients , @ had UA or NSTEMI .
RESULTS	There was no evidence for heterogeneity among the subgroups for any of the outcome variables ( all p values > @ ) .
RESULTS	Using FFR to guide PCI resulted in similar risk reductions of major adverse cardiac events and its components in patients with UA or NSTEMI , compared with patients with SA ( absolute risk reduction of @ % vs. @ % , respectively , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In patients with UA or NSTEMI , the number of stents was reduced without increase in hospital stay or procedure time and with less contrast use , in similarity to stable patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefit of using FFR to guide PCI in multivessel disease does not differ between patients with UA or NSTEMI , compared with patients with SA .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the correlation between the presence and titer of host-derived antibody reactivity , circulating immune complexes , and clinical course and prognosis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( SCCHN ) .
METHODS	Serum samples , obtained from untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx entered onto a multiinstitutional trial , were evaluated for the presence of elevated circulating immune complexes ( @ patients ) and host-derived antibody directed against two SCCHN cell lines ( @ patients ) .
RESULTS	Patients had significantly elevated levels of circulating immune complexes as measured by C@q binding compared with normal controls .
RESULTS	Patients with higher levels of circulating immune complexes were less likely to respond to chemotherapy .
RESULTS	No correlations were noted between immune complex levels and stage of disease , nodal status , site of disease , recurrence , or survival .
RESULTS	Evaluation of native antibody titers for their relationship to clinical correlates showed no statistically significant associations .
RESULTS	In sera subjected to immune complex dissociation , patients with moderately or poorly differentiated tumors had significantly higher antibody titers when compared with patients with well-differentiated tumors .
RESULTS	Because marked variation in the increase of antibody titers following immune complex dissociation was noted , the ratio of immune complex-dissociated to native antibody titer was examined .
RESULTS	Patients with a high ratio had a lower proportion of complete and partial responses to chemotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results support the conclusion that the formation of tumor-associated immune complexes in patients with SCCHN is associated with a decreased response to chemotherapy .

OBJECTIVE	The combination of a hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) protease inhibitor , peginterferon , and ribavirin is the standard of care for patients with HCV genotype @ infection .
OBJECTIVE	We report the efficacy and safety of response-guided therapy with danoprevir ( a potent second-generation protease inhibitor ) , peginterferon alfa-@a ( @ KD ) , and ribavirin in these patients .
METHODS	Treatment-nave patients ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to groups given @ weeks of danoprevir ( @ mg every @ hours ; @ mg every @ hours , and @ mg every @ hours ) or placebo plus peginterferon alfa-@a and ribavirin , followed by peginterferon alfa-@a and ribavirin .
METHODS	Patients given danoprevir who had an extended rapid virologic response ( eRVR@-@ : HCV RNA < @ IU/mL during weeks @-@ ) stopped therapy at week @ ; those without an eRVR@-@ continued therapy to @ weeks .
METHODS	Patients who were given placebo received @ weeks of peginterferon alfa-@a and ribavirin .
METHODS	The primary efficacy end point was sustained virologic response ( SVR : HCV RNA < @ IU/mL after @ weeks without treatment ) .
RESULTS	Rates of SVR were higher among patients given danoprevir @ mg ( @ % ) , @ mg ( @ % ) , and @ mg ( @ % ) than placebo ( @ % ) ( @ % confidence interval : @ % -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Seventy-nine percent of patients given danoprevir @ mg had an eRVR@-@ ; among these , @ % had an SVR .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events were reported in @ % to @ % of patients given danoprevir and @ % given placebo .
RESULTS	Four patients given danoprevir ( @ patient in the @-mg group and @ in the @-mg group ) had reversible , grade @ increases in alanine aminotransferase , which led to early discontinuation of the @-mg arm of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of danoprevir , peginterferon alfa-@a , and ribavirin leads to high rates of SVR in patients with HCV genotype @ infection , but high doses of danoprevir can lead to grade @ increases in alanine aminotransferase .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies of lower doses of danoprevir with ritonavir , to reduce overall danoprevir exposure while maintaining potent antiviral activity , are underway ; Clinicaltrials.gov number , NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Active recruitment of smokers increases the reach of quitlines ; however , some quitlines restrict proactive telephone counselling ( i.e. counsellor-initiated calls ) to smokers ready to quit within @ days .
OBJECTIVE	Identifying characteristics associated with successful quitting by actively recruited smokers could help to distinguish those most likely to benefit from proactive telephone counselling .
OBJECTIVE	This study assessed the baseline characteristics of actively recruited smokers associated with prolonged abstinence at @ , @ and @ months and the proportion achieving prolonged abstinence that would miss out on proactive telephone counselling if such support was offered only to smokers intending to quit within @ days at baseline .
METHODS	Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in which the baseline characteristics associated with prolonged abstinence were examined .
METHODS	New South Wales ( NSW ) community , Australia .
METHODS	A total of @ smokers recruited at random from the electronic NSW telephone directory .
METHODS	Baseline socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics associated with prolonged abstinence at @ , @ and @ months post-recruitment .
RESULTS	Waiting more than an hour to smoke after waking and intention to quit within @ days at baseline predicted five of the six prolonged abstinence measures .
RESULTS	If proactive telephone counselling was restricted to smokers who at baseline intended to quit within @ days , @-@ @ % of experimental group participants who achieved prolonged abstinence would miss out on telephone support .
CONCLUSIONS	Less addicted and more motivated smokers who are actively recruited to quitline support are more likely to achieve abstinence .
CONCLUSIONS	Most actively recruited smokers reported no intention to quit within the next @ days , but such smokers still achieved long-term abstinence .

BACKGROUND	Use of cholesterol-lowering regimens has been shown to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) , both in primary and secondary prevention .
BACKGROUND	However , there have been few studies of the relative benefits and risks of the various cholesterol-lowering agents in patient groups with specific risk factors for CHD .
OBJECTIVE	The primary goal of this study was to compare the proportions of adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and a moderate to high risk for CHD achieving National Cholesterol Education Program low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) goals with titrate-to-goal regimens of simvastatin and fluvastatin .
METHODS	This was a multicenter , prospective , randomized , double-blind , parallel-group study enrolling adult patients with type IIa or IIb primary hypercholesterolemia , LDL-C levels < @ mmol/L ( < @ mg/dL ) , and triglyceride levels < @ mmol/L ( < @ mg/dL ) , and either CHD or other atherosclerotic disease ( the CHD , or high-risk , group ) , or multiple risk factors for CHD ( the MRF , or moderate-risk , group ) .
METHODS	After a @-week washout period , patients were randomized to @ weeks of treatment at an initial dosage of simvastatin @ mg once daily or fluvastatin @ mg once daily .
METHODS	At @ - and @-week titration visits , the dosage in patients who had not acheived the LDL-C goal could be increased to simvastatin @ mg once daily and then @ mg once daily , or to fluvastatin @ mg once daily and then @ mg twice daily .
METHODS	Lipid profiles were obtained at each titration visit and at the end of treatment .
METHODS	In addition to the comparison between treatments , secondary comparisons were made between the CHD and MRF subgroups within each treatment group .
METHODS	Statistical significance was assessed using analysis of variance .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were enrolled , @ in the simvastatin group and @ in the fluvastatin group .
RESULTS	There were no significant between-group differences in patients ' characteristics at baseline .
RESULTS	At the end of the study , @ % ( @/@ ) of patients in the simvastatin group had reached target LDL-C goals , compared with @ % ( @/@ ) in the fluvastatin group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the simvastatin CHD and MRF subgroups , @ % and @ % , respectively , reached the LDL-C target , compared with @ % and @ % in the corresponding fluvastatin subgroups ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients requiring titration was higher in the fluvastatin group than in the simvastatin group ( @ % and @ % , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of adverse events was similar between groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , more patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and CHD or multiple risk factors for CHD reached LDL-C goals with simvastatin treatment and required less titration than those who received fluvastatin treatment .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and safety of hybrid laser treatment , i.e. the combination of visual Nd-YAG laser ablation of prostate and contact Nd-YAG laser vaporization of prostate , with transurethral resection of the prostate ( TURP ) in the treatment of patients with symptomatic bladder outlet obstruction secondary to a benign high-volume prostate .
METHODS	Forty-five symptomatic patients with hyperplastic prostates of > @ mL were randomized to undergo either hybrid laser treatment ( @ ) or TURP ( @ ) .
METHODS	All patients were evaluated before and after treatment with a complex urodynamic assessment , and were accepted into the study only if they had infravesical obstruction in the pressure-flow study .
METHODS	In the hybrid method , Nd-YAG laser energy was first delivered by an ` adenoma-dependent ' approach to all areas of the obstructing lateral lobe tissue through a side-firing gold-alloy tip fibre at @ W for @ s of ` burn ' .
METHODS	The prostatic urethra was then opened and the median lobe vaporized using the a contact probe at @ W. Patients were re-evaluated @ and @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	Both treatments proved to be safe , and improved the subjective and objective outcome measures at @ and @ months compared with baseline values .
RESULTS	After @ months , there was a greater improvement in the TURP group in peak urinary flow rate ( Qmax ; P < @ ) , mean urinary flow rate ( Qave ; P < @ ) and postvoid residual urine volume ( P < @ ) than in the hybrid laser group .
RESULTS	After @ months , there was a greater improvement in the TURP group in detrusor pressure at Qmax ( P < @ ) , Qave ( P < @ ) and prostate size ( P < @ ) than in the hybrid laser group .
RESULTS	In the pressure-flow study at @ months , a higher proportion of patients ( seven of @ ) were still obstructed in the hybrid laser group than in TURP group ( two of @ ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	TURP caused more intraoperative blood loss ( P < @ ) and postoperative problems associated with bleeding ; @ % of hybrid laser patients were discharged with a suprapubic catheter , whereas all TURP patients could urinate at discharge ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The duration of bladder drainage was longer after hybrid laser treatment ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The hybrid laser method was a safe but less effective treatment than TURP for benign prostatic enlargement in patients with prostates of > @ mL .

BACKGROUND	Niacin monotherapy in patients with dyslipidemia and impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) may result in hyperglycemia .
BACKGROUND	Colesevelam has the unique dual approvals to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) and to improve glycemic control in type @ diabetes mellitus .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of combined colesevelam and niacin treatment on LDL-C-lowering and glycemic control in subjects with IFG and dyslipidemia .
METHODS	Men or women @ years of age , with dyslipidemia ( non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol @ mg/dL and @ mg/dL ; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < @ mg/dL ) and fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) @ mg/dL and @ mg/dL were randomly assigned @:@ to colesevelam ( @ mg/d ) with niacin titration ( n = @ ) or placebo with niacin titration ( n = @ ) over @ weeks .
METHODS	Niacin was titrated from @ mg/d up to a maximum of @ mg/d as tolerated , and all subjects took enteric-coated aspirin daily .
METHODS	Lipid and glycemic efficacy parameters were assessed as well as safety evaluations of adverse events , vital signs , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , hematology , and urinalysis .
RESULTS	Adjunct colesevelam had significantly greater LDL-C-lowering effect than niacin alone ( placebo ) ; -@ % vs -@ % , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Niacin-mediated increases in FPG were significantly less with adjunct colesevelam ( @ mg/dL vs @ mg/dL ; P = @ ) , and fewer colesevelam subjects had increases of @ mg/dL in FPG ( @ vs @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Adjunct colesevelam resulted in significantly smaller increases in hemoglobin A@c than placebo ( @ % vs @ % , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Consistent with hemoglobin A@c and FPG changes , fructosamine levels significantly decreased with colesevelam treatment ( -@ mol/L ) but increased with placebo ( @ mol/L ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Colesevelam as an adjunct to niacin therapy further lowers LDL-C while obviating the adverse effects of niacin on glucose metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia and IFG .

BACKGROUND	Devices that monitor the depth of anesthesia are increasingly used to titrate sedation and avoid awareness during anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	Many of these monitors are based upon electroencephalography ( EEG ) collected from large adult reference populations and not pediatric populations ( Anesthesiology , @ , @ , @ ; Journal of Anaesthesia , @ , @ , @ ; Anesthesiology , @ , @ , @ ) .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that EEG patterns in children would be different from those previously reported in adults and that they would show anesthetic-specific characteristics .
METHODS	This prospective observational study was approved by the Institutional Review Board , and informed written consent was obtained .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive maintenance anesthesia with isoflurane or sevoflurane .
METHODS	EEG data collection included at least @ min at steady-state maintenance anesthesia .
METHODS	The EEG was recorded continuously through emergence until after extubation .
METHODS	A mixed model procedure was performed on global and regional power by pooled data analysis and by analyzing each anesthetic group separately .
METHODS	Statistical significance was defined as P < @ .
RESULTS	Thirty-seven children completed the study ( ages @ days-@ @ years ) .
RESULTS	Isoflurane and sevoflurane had different effects on global and regional EEG power during emergence from anesthesia , and frontal predominance patterns were significantly different between these two anesthetic agents .
CONCLUSIONS	The principal finding of the present study was that there are anesthetic-specific and concentration-dependent EEG effects in children .
CONCLUSIONS	Depth-of-anesthesia monitors that utilize algorithms based on the EEGs of adult reference populations therefore may not be appropriate for use in children .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the impact on visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain scores of allowing male patients to view the procedure of flexible cystoscopy .
METHODS	A total of @ male patients admitted to our hospital for flexile cystoscopy by a single urologist between @ and @ were randomized to two equal groups .
METHODS	Group @ included @ patients who were allowed to watch the video screen with the urologist .
METHODS	Group @ included @ patients who were unable to view the video monitor .
METHODS	All patients received the same real-time explanation during the cystoscopy .
METHODS	Patients recorded their pain feeling on a VAS ranging from @ to @ after the physician completed the cystoscopy .
METHODS	The pulse and respiratory rate were also recorded @ minutes before the procedure and immediately after the procedure .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in the postprocedure pulse rate and respiratory rate between groups .
RESULTS	The mean pain score on the VAS in group @ was statistically significantly lower than that in group @ ( @ vs @ , P < @ , Mann-Whitney U test ) .
RESULTS	Patients who were allowed to watch the video screen experienced less discomfort at cystoscopy .
CONCLUSIONS	Real-time visualization of flexible cystoscopy with simultaneous explanation improves male patients ' comfort .

OBJECTIVE	We previously reported that nifedipine retard showed comparable efficacy to angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors for the prevention of cardiac events in hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease during the Japan Multicenter Investigation for Cardiovascular Diseases B study .
OBJECTIVE	In the nifedipine group , patients with a history of myocardial infarction ( MI ) showed a significant reduction in hospitalization for angina pectoris compared with the ACE inhibitor group .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether this difference was related to the progression of coronary arteriosclerosis .
METHODS	To evaluate coronary arteriosclerosis , we performed coronary angiography ( CAG ) and a quantitative analysis of coronary angiograms .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of hospitalization for angina was significantly lower in the nifedipine group ( log-rank test P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The etiology of angina requiring hospitalization was determined on the basis of CAG findings .
RESULTS	Its incidence secondary to the development of new lesions or the progression of existing lesions was significantly lower in the nifedipine group than in the ACE inhibitor group ( log-rank test P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Using quantitative coronary analysis , changes in the coronary artery luminal diameter were compared between the nifedipine and ACE inhibitor groups .
RESULTS	The minimum coronary lumen diameter did not show a significant change in the nifedipine group , whereas it decreased significantly in the ACE inhibitor group ( paired t-test P = @ ) , and there was a significant difference between the two groups by analysis of covariance ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that nifedipine more effectively prevented admission for angina pectoris by inhibiting the progression of coronary artery disease in patients with a history of MI .

BACKGROUND	The authors conducted a prospective , randomized , single-blind study to determine the degree of pulpal anesthesia obtained with a primary infiltration of @ cartridge of articaine in the incisive/mental nerve region of the mandibular second premolar and to determine the anesthetic efficacy of a repeat articaine infiltration @ minutes after the primary infiltration .
METHODS	One hundred asymptomatic adult subjects randomly received @ sets of injections consisting of a primary mandibular second premolar infiltration of @ cartridge of @ % articaine with @:@,@ epinephrine plus a repeat infiltration @ minutes later ( using the same volume of articaine ) or a mock repeat infiltration in @ separate appointments spaced at least @ week apart .
METHODS	The authors used an electric pulp tester to test the first molar , premolars , canine , and incisors for anesthesia in @-minute cycles for @ minutes .
RESULTS	The success rates of the initial infiltrations for the first molar , canine , and incisor teeth ranged from @ % to @ % .
RESULTS	The premolar success rates were moderately successful ( ie , @ % -@ % ) , but anesthesia declined after @-@ minutes .
RESULTS	The repeat infiltration at @ minutes significantly increased the success rate ( @ % -@ % ) and the duration of pulpal anesthesia for the premolars .
CONCLUSIONS	The initial infiltration was not effective in anesthetizing the first molar , canine , or incisor teeth and was only moderately successful in the premolars .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the repeat infiltration significantly increased the success rate and duration in the premolars , the initial infiltration success rates were not high enough to support the use of this regimen as a combined anesthetic technique .

BACKGROUND	Lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercise prescription proved effective for managing low back pain in primary care in a clinical trial .
OBJECTIVE	To understand trial participants ' expectations and experiences of the Alexander Technique and exercise prescription .
METHODS	A questionnaire assessing attitudes to the intervention , based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour , was completed at baseline and @-month follow-up by @ people assigned to lessons in the Alexander Technique and @ people assigned to exercise prescription .
METHODS	Semi-structured interviews to assess the beliefs contributing to attitudes to the intervention were carried out at baseline with@ people assigned to the lessons in the Alexander Technique and @ to exercise prescription , and at follow-up with @ members of the baseline sample .
RESULTS	Questionnaire responses indicated that attitudes to both interventions were positive at baseline but became more positive at follow-up only in those assigned to lessons in the Alexander Technique .
RESULTS	Thematic analysis of the interviews suggested that at follow-up many patients who had learned the Alexander Technique felt they could manage back pain better .
RESULTS	Whereas many obstacles to exercising were reported , few barriers to learning the Alexander Technique were described , since it ` made sense ' , could be practiced while carrying out everyday activities or relaxing , and the teachers provided personal advice and support .
CONCLUSIONS	Using the Alexander Technique was viewed as effective by most patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Acceptability may have been superior to exercise because of a convincing rationale and social support and a better perceived fit with the patient 's particular symptoms and lifestyle .

OBJECTIVE	Three dosage regimens of a new recombinant glycosylated prourokinase ( A-@ ) were evaluated by measuring coronary artery patency at @ min in patients with acute myocardial infarction .
BACKGROUND	Prourokinase is a thrombolytic drug with unique pharmacologic properties that may be clinically advantageous .
METHODS	Aspirin ( @ mg ) , intravenous heparin and prourokinase ( @ - or @-mg monotherapy or @ mg `` primed '' with a preceding bolus dose of @,@ IU of recombinant urokinase ) were administered to @ patients .
METHODS	Coronary angiography was performed at @ min ( wherever possible ) , @ min ( primary end point ) and @ h to determine arterial patency and reocclusion rates .
METHODS	Plasma was collected serially to measure fibrinogen , plasminogen , thrombin antithrombin III and fibrinopeptide A. Clinical events until hospital discharge were recorded .
RESULTS	The coronary artery patency rate at @ min was similar for all three regimens , averaging @ % ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] @ % to @ % ) ; Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) grade @ flow rates averaged @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Arterial patency at @ min was @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) , and reocclusion occurred in @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Prourokinase demonstrated relative fibrin specificity at all doses studied .
RESULTS	Fibrinopeptide A and thrombin antithrombin III levels were elevated at baseline and declined rapidly during the @st @ h.
RESULTS	There was no difference in the baseline values of these thrombin markers between patients with patent versus closed arteries at @ min .
RESULTS	There was one death ; no strokes occurred .
CONCLUSIONS	A-@ prourokinase is a rapid-acting , effective fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent .
CONCLUSIONS	Reocclusion was unusual , possibly because of aggressive anticoagulation with intravenous heparin or unique features of the drug .

BACKGROUND	Referral for brief intervention among people who misuse alcohol is reported to be effective but its impact among those who present to services following deliberate self-harm ( DSH ) has not been examined .
METHODS	Consecutive patients who presented to an Emergency Department ( ED ) following an episode of DSH were screened for alcohol misuse .
METHODS	Those found to be misusing alcohol were randomly assigned to brief intervention plus a health information leaflet or to a health information leaflet alone .
METHODS	The primary outcome was whether the patient reattended an ED following a further episode of DSH during the subsequent @ months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were alcohol consumption , mental health and satisfaction with care measured @ and @ months after randomization .
RESULTS	One hundred and three people took part in the study .
RESULTS	Follow-up data on our primary outcome were obtained for all subjects and on @ % for secondary outcomes .
RESULTS	Half those referred for brief intervention received it .
RESULTS	Repetition of DSH was strongly associated with baseline alcohol consumption , but not influenced by treatment allocation .
RESULTS	There was a non-significant trend towards the number of units of alcohol consumed per drinking day being lower among those randomized to brief intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	Referral for brief intervention for alcohol misuse following an episode of DSH may not influence the likelihood of repetition of self-harm .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer-term interventions may be needed to help people who deliberately harm themselves and have evidence of concurrent alcohol misuse .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the role of preserved pleural integrity in postoperative pain and respiratory functional status in patients undergoing coronary revascularization .
METHODS	Two hundred forty patients undergoing on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting between March @ and February @ were included in the present study .
METHODS	The patients were prospectively randomized and divided into either an opened pleura ( OP ) group ( n = @ , patients with an OP ) or a closed pleura ( CP ) group ( n = @ , patients whose pleural integrity was preserved ) .
METHODS	Preoperative patient characteristics were similar .
METHODS	Postoperative respiratory functions were compared between the groups by chest x-rays , respiratory functional tests and arterial blood gas analyses .
METHODS	Postoperative pain was compared by using a multidimensional pain score .
METHODS	All the tests were examined by the same blinded clinician .
RESULTS	The mean age of the patients was @ + / -@ years .
RESULTS	Postoperative bleeding and the duration of hospital stay were markedly higher in the OP group than in the CP group .
RESULTS	The incidences of atelectasis and pleural effusion were also significantly higher in the OP group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Respiratory functions and postoperative pain scores were better in the CP group ( P < @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Preserving pleural integrity has beneficial effects on the respiratory functions and postoperative pain after coronary revascularization .
CONCLUSIONS	The preservation of pleural integrity results in better respiratory function , decreased hospital stay and cost , and as a consequence , a better surgical outcome .

OBJECTIVE	In behavioral research directed at the treatment of type @ diabetes , the challenge is to understand how interventions might facilitate long-term lifestyle changes .
OBJECTIVE	The Mediterranean Lifestyle Program ( MLP ) is an intervention for postmenopausal women diagnosed with type @ diabetes that has shown promising effects on outcomes that include increased physical activity and reduced fat consumption .
OBJECTIVE	The present study extended previous findings by evaluating diet-specific and activity-specific social-ecological resources as possible mediators of intervention effects over a @-year period .
METHODS	Percent calories from saturated fat and caloric expenditure per week in all physical activities were assessed with self-report questionnaires .
RESULTS	The MLP was successful in increasing participants ' use of diet-specific and activity-specific family/friend and neighborhood resources .
RESULTS	There was some evidence that changes in those resources mediated intervention effects on saturated fat consumption and physical activity outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	The experimental manipulation of mediators and the demonstrated mediational effects provided some support for the conclusion that social-ecological resources can contribute to improvements in healthful lifestyles for women with type @ diabetes .

OBJECTIVE	Leucocyte filtration of salvaged blood has been suggested to prevent patients from receiving activated leucocytes during auto-transfusion in cardiac surgery .
OBJECTIVE	This study examines whether leucocyte filtration of salvaged blood affects the red blood cell ( RBC ) function and whether there is a difference between filtration of the concentrated and diluted blood on RBC function .
METHODS	Forty patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly divided into a group receiving leucocyte filtration of concentrated blood ( High-Hct , n = @ ) and another group receiving leucocyte filtration of the diluted blood ( Low-Hct , n = @ ) .
METHODS	During operation , all the salvaged blood , as well as the residual blood , from the heart-lung machine was filtered .
METHODS	In the High-Hct group , blood was concentrated with a cell saver prior to filtration , whereas in the Low-Hct group , blood was filtered without concentration .
METHODS	RBC function was represented by RBC aggregation and deformability measured by a laser-assisted optical rotational cell analyser and by the RBC @,@-diphosphoglycerate ( @,@-DPG ) and adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) contents with conventional biochemical tests .
RESULTS	Leucocyte filtration of diluted blood with a low haematocrit ( @ + / -@ % ) did not affect RBC function .
RESULTS	However , when the concentrated blood with a high haematocrit ( @ + / -@ % ) was filtered , there was a reduction of ATP content in RBCs after passing through the filter ( from @ + / -@ micromol g ( -@ ) Hb to @ + / -@ micromol g ( -@ ) Hb , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	For patients who received the concentrated blood , their in vivo RBC function did not differ from those who received diluted blood .
CONCLUSIONS	Leucocyte filtration of the diluted salvaged blood during cardiac surgery does not affect RBC function , but it tends to deplete the ATP content of RBCs as the salvaged blood has been concentrated prior to filtration .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the clinical results between computer assisted minimally invasive spine surgery ( CAMISS ) and traditional open fixation surgery which used in thoracolumbar fractures .
METHODS	A prospective randomized controlled trial of patients who had undergone surgery for thoracolumbar fracture from January @ to March @ was performed .
METHODS	The patients were randomly divided into CAMISS group and traditional open treatment group ( control group ) by random number table .
METHODS	Clinical results were assessed by comparing the following parameters between patients who had undergone CAMISS or traditional open surgery : operative time , estimated blood loss , visual analogue scale ( VAS ) of the low back pain , the accuracy of pedicle screw , the status and the correction of kyphosis .
RESULTS	Forty-seven patients underwent CAMISS , and fifty patients underwent traditional open surgery .
RESULTS	The follow-up periods were @ - @ months ( mean @ months ) .
RESULTS	According to the preoperative data , the two groups did not differ with respect to age , gender , marriage , occupation , mechanism of injury , classification of fracture , preoperative VAS scores of the low back pain , preoperative functional spine unit ( FSU ) Cobb 's angle and preoperative local angle of the fracture vertebral body ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Compare to the control group , the patients who got CAMISS had more accuracy of pedicle screw , less blood loss , short immobilized time , lower postoperative fever , and better VAS score of the low back pain ( t = @ - @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The improvement of FSU Cobb 's angle and local angle of the fracture vertebral body were better at control group after operation ( @ @ vs. @ @ , @ @ vs. @ @ , t = @ and @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	But there was no significant difference of the FSU Cobb 's angle , or local angle of the fracture vertebral body between the two groups at post-operation and follow-up ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CAMISS has the characteristics of fewer traumas , less bleeding , faster recovery , high accuracy of pedicle screws .
CONCLUSIONS	It has comparable vertebral deformity correction and fixation result of the traditional open operation .

BACKGROUND	Although physical activity is beneficial for breast cancer survivors , the majority do not meet public health physical activity recommendations .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to test a social cognitive theory model of physical activity behavior in a sample of long-term breast cancer survivors using both self-report and objective measures of physical activity .
METHODS	Participants ( N = @ ) completed measures of physical activity , self-efficacy , goals , outcome expectations , fatigue , and social support at baseline and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	A subsample ( n = @ ) was randomly selected to wear an accelerometer .
METHODS	It was hypothesized that self-efficacy directly and indirectly influences physical activity through goals , social support , fatigue , and outcome expectations .
METHODS	Relationships were examined using panel analysis within a covariance modeling framework .
RESULTS	The hypothesized model provided a good model-data fit ( ( @ ) = @ , df = @ , p = < @ , CFI = @ , SRMR = @ ) in the full sample when controlling for covariates .
RESULTS	At baseline , self-efficacy directly and indirectly , via goals , outcome expectations , and social support , influenced physical activity .
RESULTS	These relationships were also supported across time .
RESULTS	Additionally , the hypothesized model was supported in the subsample with accelerometer data ( @ = @ , df = @ , p < @ , CFI = @ , SRMR = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study validates a social cognitive model for understanding physical activity behavior in long-term breast cancer survivors .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should be designed to replicate this model in other breast cancer survivor populations , and the findings should be applied to the development of future physical activity programs and studies for this population .

OBJECTIVE	To study the ability of volume-controlled ventilation and medicated ( normal saline plus surfactant ) bronchoalveolar lavage in aspiration to reduce the duration of intubation and improve gas exchange .
METHODS	: Randomized controlled clinical trial .
METHODS	Pediatric intensive care unit .
METHODS	Twenty children , @ month to @ yrs old , who were intubated and mechanically ventilated , were randomized within @ hrs of aspiration to receive volume-controlled ventilation plus medicated bronchoalveolar lavage ( treatment group ) or the same ventilation and bronchosuction ( control group ) .
METHODS	Volume-controlled ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure ( @-@ cm H@O ) were applied .
METHODS	Medicated bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using five aliquots of @ mL of saline plus @ mg/mL Curosurf ( porcine surfactant , Chiesi Pharmaceutical SpA , Parma , Italy ) in infants , five boluses of @ mL of saline plus @ mg/mL Curosurf in children , and four boluses of @ mL of saline with @ mg/mL Curosurf in adolescents for each affected lobe .
METHODS	One hour after bronchoalveolar lavage , @ mg of Curosurf was administered locally .
RESULTS	All patients survived .
RESULTS	In the treatment group , days of intubation were @ ( + / -@ ) , oxygenation index and Pao@/Fio@ improved significantly at @ hrs , and statistical reduction in tidal volume mL/kg was observed from @ hrs .
RESULTS	In the control group , days of intubation were @ ( + / -@ ) ( p < @ ) , no improvement in oxygenation was noted , and pneumonia was observed in seven children ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Even though this was an unblinded small clinical trial and low tidal volume strategy was not employed at an early stage after lung injury , there is some evidence that bronchoalveolar lavage with normal saline and surfactant may have clinical value in treating severe aspiration syndrome in children .
CONCLUSIONS	More clinical studies are warranted to overcome study limitations and potential bias .

METHODS	Children were recruited at clinics in Kingston , Jamaica , and supplemented at home .
METHODS	Children selected were singletons aged @-@ months , and stunted ( < -@ s.d. length for age , NCHS references ) .
METHODS	They were stratified by sex and age and randomly assigned to receive zinc supplement ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Four children were excluded because of hospitalization ; all others had all measurements .
METHODS	Adequately nourished children ( n = @ ) were recruited from a well-baby clinic .
METHODS	The supplement provided @ mg elemental zinc in a syrup daily for @ weeks ; the placebo comprised the syrup only .
METHODS	Caretakers were interviewed to obtain social background data , number of clinic visits and hospitalizations .
METHODS	Anthropometric measurements were done on enrolment , and after @ weeks , @ weeks and @ months .
METHODS	Children 's health was determined by weekly questionnaire to caretakers of the undernourished groups during the supplementation period .
RESULTS	The supplemented and placebo groups were similar on enrolment .
RESULTS	The adequately nourished children were from significantly better socio-economic circumstances .
RESULTS	Mean initial hair zinc content was @ + / - @ mumol/g ( supplemented group ) and @ + / - @ mumol/g ( placebo ) ( n.s. ) .
RESULTS	Regression analyses showed that there were no significant effects of supplementation on length , height or head circumference , nor on the incidence of any morbidity symptom .
RESULTS	Mean duration of the episodes was significantly shorter for skin rashes in the supplemented group compared with the control group ( ANCOVA , P = @ ) , and longer for vomiting ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of hospitalization was significantly greater in the control group ( Fisher 's exact test , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Zinc supplementation reduced the hospitalizations which probably reflect severity of morbidity , but did not improve growth .

BACKGROUND	This study focused on the change in the range of motion ( ROM ) during the perioperative period , i.e. , the preoperative and intraoperative ROM , and that on discharge , and compared the difference between posterior cruciate ligament-retaining ( PCLR ) and - sacrificing ( PCLS ) prostheses .
METHODS	In this prospectively randomized study , we compared the changes in the ROM in PCLR ( n = @ ) and PCLS ( n = @ ) total knee arthroplasties .
RESULTS	The mean flexion in PCLR prostheses was @ degrees preoperatively , @ degrees intraoperatively , and @ degrees at discharge , and @ degrees , @ degrees , and @ degrees , respectively , in PCLS .
RESULTS	The designs did not differ statistically in each period ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Both designs showed significant correlations between the preoperative and intraoperative ROM , and between the preoperative and discharge ROM .
RESULTS	Only the PCLS showed a significant correlation between the intraoperative and discharge ROM , and a significant difference was observed in correlation of rank coefficient between the two prostheses ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The PCLS design has an advantage in rehabilitation planning because of the predictable changes in the ROM during the perioperative period , although the acquired average ROM at discharge did not differ statistically .

OBJECTIVE	Our purpose was to evaluate intraindividually the performance of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) and non-contrast MRA for aortic root diameter measurements and to compare the results with routinely performed echocardiography in patients with suspected Marfan syndrome .
METHODS	Aortic roots were examined prospectively in @ consecutive patients with suspected Marfan syndrome by using contrast-enhanced MRA and non-contrast MRA at @ T. Two readers independently measured aortic root diameters at the annulus , sinuses of Valsalva and sinutubular junction in both data sets and compared results with echocardiographic data .
METHODS	Intraclass correlation coefficient , Pearson correlation coefficient , Bland-Altman , and two-sided t-test were used to assess agreement between observers and methods .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) of the @ patients ( @ female , @ male ; mean age @ @ years ) had Marfan syndrome .
RESULTS	Both , contrast-enhanced MRA and non-contrast MRA measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva revealed a strong correlation with echocardiography ( r = @ and r = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Intraclass correlation was markedly better for non-enhanced MRA ( r = @ ) when compared to contrast-enhanced MRA ( r = @ ) .
RESULTS	Image quality ( p < @ ) as well as interobserver agreement ( p < @ ) of measurements of the sinuses of Valsalva was significantly better for non-enhanced MRA than for contrast-enhanced MRA .
CONCLUSIONS	Non-contrast MRA was more reliable and more valid than contrast-enhanced MRA for assessment of aortic root dimensions in patients with suspected Marfan syndrome .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore contrast agents can be omitted for establishing the diagnosis of aortic involvement in Marfan syndrome .

BACKGROUND	Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) is the primary therapeutic target in the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( ATP III ) guidelines .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the hypothesis that ezetimibe/simvastatin , a lipid-lowering agent that inhibits both intestinal cholesterol absorption and cholesterol synthesis , provides greater LDL-C reductions than atorvastatin across dose ranges .
METHODS	This multicenter , double-blind , @-week parallel-group study randomized @ patients with LDL-C above ATP III goal to atorvastatin ( @ , @ , @ , or @ mg ) or to ezetimibe/simvastatin ( @/@ , @/@ , @/@ , or @/@ mg ) .
METHODS	Patients were stratified by prerandomization LDL-C level .
RESULTS	At each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison , and averaged across doses , ezetimibe/simvastatin provided greater LDL-C reductions ( @ % -@ % ) than atorvastatin ( @ % -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Ezetimibe/simvastatin @/@ and @/@ mg also provided significantly greater high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) increases than atorvastatin @ and @ mg .
RESULTS	Triglyceride reductions were similar for all comparisons .
RESULTS	More ezetimibe/simvastatin than atorvastatin patients with coronary heart disease ( CHD ) or CHD risk equivalents attained the ATP III LDL-C goal of < @ mg/dL and the optional LDL-C target of < @ mg/dL .
RESULTS	C-reactive protein reductions were similar between treatment groups .
RESULTS	Consecutive elevations in alanine aminotransferase and/or aspartate aminotransferase occurred in significantly more atorvastatin patients than ezetimibe/simvastatin patients .
RESULTS	No myopathy or liver-related adverse events led to study discontinuation with either drug .
CONCLUSIONS	Ezetimibe/simvastatin was more effective than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C at each dose comparison and provided greater increases in HDL-C at the @ - and @-mg statin dose .
CONCLUSIONS	Ezetimibe/simvastatin is a highly efficacious , well-tolerated treatment option for hypercholesterolemic patients .

OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that the use of an automated external defibrillator by police and fire fighters results in higher discharge rates for out of hospital cardiac arrest .
METHODS	Controlled clinical trial with initial random allocation of automated external defibrillators to first responders in four of the eight participating regions ; each region switched from control to experimental , and vice versa , every four months .
METHODS	Amsterdam and surroundings , the Netherlands .
METHODS	Patients with witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrests , identified by the emergency medical system between January @ and January @ .
METHODS	Survival to hospital discharge ; return of spontaneous circulation ; admission to hospital .
RESULTS	@ patients ( @ % in ventricular fibrillation ) were included in the experimental area and @ patients ( @ % in ventricular fibrillation ) in the control area .
RESULTS	The median time interval between collapse and first shock was @ seconds in the experimental area and @ seconds in the control area ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients in the experimental area versus @ ( @ % ) patients in the control area were discharged ( odds ratio @ ( @ % confidence interval @ to @ ) , P = @ ) , @ ( @ % ) experimental versus @ ( @ % ) control patients had return of spontaneous circulation ( @ ( @ to @ ) , P = @ ) , and @ ( @ % ) experimental versus @ ( @ % ) control patients were admitted ( @ ( @ to @ ) , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The median delay from receipt of call to dispatch of the ambulance was @ seconds , and the delay to dispatch of the first responder was @ seconds .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of automated external defibrillators by first responders did not significantly increase survival to discharge from hospital , although it did improve return of spontaneous circulation and admission to hospital .
CONCLUSIONS	Improved dispatch procedures should increase the success of programmes of first responders using external defibrillators .

BACKGROUND	Anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle ( ATIO ) has become a popular surgical treatment for dissociated vertical deviation ( DVD ) , particularly in patients with coexisting inferior oblique muscle overaction ( IOOA ) .
BACKGROUND	We wanted to assess whether adding a resection improves the outcome compared with standard anteriorization .
METHODS	We undertook a prospective , randomized evaluation of ATIO , with and without a @-mm resection , in patients with DVD of at least @ PD in one eye .
METHODS	We included @ eyes of @ patients , @ eyes treated with the standard ATIO and @ treated with a @-mm resection added .
METHODS	We recorded the size of the preoperative and final DVD , grade of the preoperative and final IOOA , rates of reoperation , and complications .
METHODS	Mean follow-up was @ months in the standard group and @ months in the resection group , with a minimum of @ months for all cases .
RESULTS	The median preoperative and postoperative DVD was @ PD and @ PD in the standard group , respectively .
RESULTS	This compared with @ PD and @ PD , respectively , in the resection group , representing no statistically significant difference in outcome .
RESULTS	The presence or absence of IOOA did not influence the result of ATIO for either group .
RESULTS	No significant complications of surgery occurred in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	ATIO is an effective treatment for DVD and can be used to treat DVD in patients with or without IOOA , with few adverse effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study revealed no advantage to adding a @-mm resection to the standard procedure .

OBJECTIVE	Initial medication response has been shown to predict treatment outcome across a variety of substance use disorders , but no studies have examined the predictive power of initial response to buprenorphine-naloxone in the treatment of prescription opioid dependence .
OBJECTIVE	We therefore conducted a secondary analysis of data from the Prescription Opioid Addiction Treatment Study to determine whether initial response to buprenorphine-naloxone predicted @-week treatment outcome in a prescription opioid-dependent population .
METHODS	Using data from a multisite , randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine-naloxone plus counseling for DSM-IV prescription opioid dependence ( June @-July @ ) , we conducted a secondary analysis to investigate the relationship between initial medication response and @-week treatment outcome to establish how soon the efficacy of buprenorphine-naloxone could be predicted ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	Outcomes were determined from the Substance Use Report , a self-report measure of substance use , and confirmatory urinalysis .
METHODS	Predictive values were calculated to determine the importance of abstinence versus use at various time points within the first month of treatment ( week @ , weeks @-@ , @-@ , or @-@ ) in predicting successful versus unsuccessful treatment outcome ( based on abstinence or near-abstinence from opioids ) in the last @ weeks of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment ( weeks @-@ ) .
RESULTS	Outcome was best predicted by medication response after @ weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	Two weeks of initial abstinence was moderately predictive of treatment success ( positive predictive value = @ % ) , while opioid use in both of the first @ weeks was strongly predictive of unsuccessful treatment outcome ( negative predictive value [ NPV ] = @ % ) , especially when successful outcome was defined as total abstinence from opioids in weeks @-@ ( NPV = @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Evaluating prescription opioid-dependent patients after @ weeks of buprenorphine-naloxone treatment may help determine the likelihood of successful outcome at completion of the current treatment regimen .

OBJECTIVE	Building upon the results of an observational study , this clinical trial aimed to test the hypothesis that conducting antenatal Down syndrome screening ( DSS ) at the same time as other tests result in higher rates of informed choice to accept DSS , than when it is conducted separately from other tests .
METHODS	The trial used a cluster-randomised controlled design , with informed choice as the outcome measure .
METHODS	The post of midwife was randomised to offer DSS at the same time as other tests ( combined visit ) or separately from other tests ( separate visit ) .
RESULTS	Overall @ % of women made an informed choice about DSS .
RESULTS	There was no difference in rates of informed choice for women accepting DSS according to the method of conducting testing ( @ % at combined visit versus @ % at separate visit , OR = @ , @ % CI : @-@ @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Rates of informed choice about DSS were low , but there was no evidence to support that hypothesis that conducting testing at that same time as other tests increased rates of informed choice .
CONCLUSIONS	This may reflect the limitations of conducting the trial in one centre .

BACKGROUND	To investigate the difference in clinical outcomes between large-diameter deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty ( L-DALK ) and standard DALK ( S-DALK ) for the treatment of keratoconus .
METHODS	@ patients ( @ eyes ) from the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center with a clinical diagnosis of keratoconus were enrolled .
METHODS	The participants were featured by the intolerance to rigid gas-permeable contact lenses or unsuccessful fitting of contact lenses .
METHODS	Using stratified blocked randomisation , eligible eyes were allocated into the L-DALK group or the S-DALK group ( @ eyes , respectively ) .
METHODS	Postoperative uncorrected visual acuity ( UCVA ) , best spectacle-corrected visual acuity ( BSCVA ) , refractive sphere , manifest cylinder and spherical equivalent refractive error were tested at @ , @ , @ and @months after surgery .
RESULTS	After surgery , the L-DALK group had better UCVA and BSCVA than the S-DALK group ( p = @ and @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	At @months , mean BSCVA was @ logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution ( logMAR ) ( Snellen equivalent , @/@ ) in the L-DALK group vs @ logMAR ( Snellen equivalent , @/@ ) in the S-DALK group .
RESULTS	Differences were observed between the L-DALK group and the S-DALK group in terms of refractive sphere ( p = @ ) , manifest cylinder ( p = @ ) and spherical equivalent refractive error ( p = @ ) at any time interval postoperatively .
RESULTS	At @months , the mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -@ D and -@ D in the L-DALK and S-DALK groups , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	L-DALK can reduce the degree of postoperative myopia and manifest astigmatism and improve visual acuity outcomes in keratoconus compared with S-DALK .

BACKGROUND	The Seattle Heart Failure Model ( SHFM ) is a well validated prediction model of all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure , but its relationship with generic health status measures has not been evaluated .
BACKGROUND	We sought to investigate relationships between SHFM scores and health utility weights , which are necessary to estimate quality-adjusted life-years in cost-effectiveness analyses .
RESULTS	We applied mixed linear regression to examine relationships between baseline SHFM scores and EQ-@D-derived health utilities collected longitudinally in a large clinical trial .
RESULTS	A@-unit increase in SHFM score ( higher predicted mortality ) was associated with a @ decrease in utility ( P < @ ) and an additional @ decrease per year ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	With SHFM score modeled as a categorical variable , EQ-@D utilities for patients with rounded SHFM scores of @ or @ were significantly lower ( -@ and -@ , respectively ; both P < @ ) and declined more rapidly over time ( -@ and -@ , respectively ; both P @ ) than for patients with scores of -@ .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with higher SHFM-predicted mortality had significantly lower health utilities atbaseline and greater rates of decline over time , compared with patients with lower SHFM-predicted mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	These relationships can be applied when examining the cost-effectiveness of heart failure interventions .

OBJECTIVE	Sildenafil relaxes smooth muscle by blocking type @ phosphodiesterase , which destroys nitric oxide-stimulated cyclic guanosine monophosphate .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study is to investigate the change of lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) and body motility with the lapse of time after sildenafil infusion in normal male adults .
METHODS	After basal esophageal manometry in eight healthy male adult volunteers , we infused a @-mg tablet of sildenafil dissolved in water in the stomach through the manometry catheter and observed the changes of LES and body motility with the lapse of time .
METHODS	We randomized the study population into two groups , and esophageal manometry was repeated in LES and body sequence in four volunteers and in body and LES sequence in the other four volunteers immediately after sildenafil infusion .
RESULTS	LES resting pressure significantly decreased after sildenafil infusion .
RESULTS	The body peristaltic amplitude gradually decreased and eventually disappeared , and the latency increased significantly after sildenafil infusion in both the proximal and distal esophagus .
CONCLUSIONS	These data support that nitric oxide mediates LES relaxation and the timing of esophageal peristalsis .
CONCLUSIONS	In the future , sildenafil can be tried in some esophageal motor disorders , which have defects in nitric oxide neuromuscular communication .

BACKGROUND	Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a decrease in cardiovascular risk , but fermented beverages seem to confer greater cardiovascular protection due to their polyphenolic content .
BACKGROUND	Circulating endothelial progenitor cells ( EPC ) are bone-marrow-derived stem cells with the ability to repair and maintain endothelial integrity and function and are considered as a surrogate marker of vascular function and cumulative cardiovascular risk .
BACKGROUND	Nevertheless , no study has been carried out on the effects of moderate beer consumption on the number of circulating EPC in high cardiovascular risk patients .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of moderate consumption of beer , non-alcoholic beer and gin on the number of circulating EPC and EPC-mobilizing factors .
METHODS	In this crossover trial , @ men at high cardiovascular risk were randomized to receive beer ( @ g alcohol/d ) , the equivalent amount of polyphenols in the form of non-alcoholic beer , or gin ( @ g alcohol/d ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Diet and physical exercise were carefully monitored .
RESULTS	The number of circulating EPC and EPC-mobilizing factors were determined at baseline and after each intervention .
RESULTS	After the beer and non-alcoholic beer interventions , the number of circulating EPC significantly increased by @ and @ units , respectively , while no significant differences were observed after the gin period .
RESULTS	In correlation , stromal cell derived factor @ increased significantly after the non-alcoholic and the beer interventions .
CONCLUSIONS	The non-alcoholic fraction of beer increases the number of circulating EPC in peripheral blood from high cardiovascular risk subjects .

OBJECTIVE	The study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FIREHAWK , a novel abluminal groove-filled biodegradable polymer sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) for treating patients with single de novo coronary lesions compared with the durable polymer everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) XIENCE V.
RESULTS	A total of @ patients with single de novo native coronary lesions @ mm in length and a coronary artery @ to @ mm in diameter were enrolled in the TARGET I study , a prospective , randomised , non-inferiority trial .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss ( LLL ) at nine-month follow-up .
RESULTS	The secondary endpoint , target lesion failure ( TLF ) , was defined as the composite of cardiac death , target vessel myocardial infarction ( TVMI ) , or ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation ( iTLR ) .
RESULTS	Patients were centrally randomised to treatment with either biodegradable polymer SES ( n = @ ) or durable polymer EES ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The nine-month in-stent LLL of the biodegradable polymer SES was comparable to the EES group ( @ @ mm vs. @ @ mm , p = @ ; difference and @ % confidence interval @ [ -@ , @ ] mm ; p for non-inferiority < @ ) .
RESULTS	Cardiac death ( @ % vs. @ % ) , TVMI ( @ % vs. @ % ) , iTLR ( @ % vs. @ % ) and TLF ( @ % vs. @ % ) were similar between the biodegradable polymer SES and durable polymer EES groups at @-month follow-up ( all p > @ ) .
RESULTS	No definite/probable stent thrombosis was observed in both of these groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In the multicentre TARGET I trial , the novel abluminal groove-filled biodegradable polymer SES FIREHAWK was non-inferior to the durable polymer EES XIENCE V with respect to the primary endpoint of in-stent LLL at nine months for treating patients with single de novo coronary lesions .
CONCLUSIONS	The incidences of clinical endpoints were low in both of the stents at @-month follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT@ ) .

OBJECTIVE	This study examines the role of self-reported trait positive affect ( PA ) on skin barrier recovery after skin disruption , and whether the role of trait PA in wound healing is consistent with the direct effects model or the stress-buffering model of PA and health .
METHODS	Sixty healthy participants ( mean age @ + / - @ years ) completed a self-report measure of trait positive and negative affect , underwent a `` tape-stripping '' procedure that disrupts normal skin barrier function , and were randomly assigned to a Stress ( Trier Social Stress Test ) or No Stress ( reading task ) condition .
METHODS	Skin barrier recovery was assessed by measuring transepidermal water loss up to @ hr after skin disruption .
RESULTS	Multilevel modeling indicated that greater trait PA was related to faster skin barrier recovery ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The effects of PA on skin barrier recovery were independent of levels of trait NA .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that trait PA may influence skin barrier recovery following a brief stressor .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , these results provide additional evidence that trait PA can positively impact objective health outcomes .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the impact of using paclitaxel-coated balloons ( PCB ) on outcome after post-angioplasty dissection in femoropopliteal arteries .
METHODS	The angiograms obtained in the THUNDER study ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT@ ) were analyzed to compare degrees of dissection and angiographic parameters between the control ( uncoated balloons , n = @ ) and treatment ( PCBs , n = @ ) groups before and after the intervention and at @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Furthermore , target lesion revascularizations ( TLR ) were documented up to @ years .
RESULTS	In each group , @ ( @ % ) patients had a dissection after the intervention .
RESULTS	At the @-month follow-up , patients with dissection of any grade after treatment with PCBs had significantly less late lumen loss ( @ mm ) than patients with dissection after treatment with uncoated balloons ( @ mm , p = @ ) and a lower degree of stenosis ( @ % vs. @ % , respectively ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with severe dissection ( grades C , D , or E ) especially seemed to benefit from the PCBs , with late lumen loss of @ mm vs. @ mm for controls ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The binary restenosis rate was also markedly lower in the PCB group ( @ % ) than in the uncoated group ( @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the @-year follow-up , TLR was performed in @ % of patients in the control group compared to @ % of patients in the PCB group ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this subgroup analysis suggest that patients with dissection following treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon have a very acceptable outcome and stent implantation is not necessary as long as the dissection does not result in acute flow limitation .

OBJECTIVE	Proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy is considered as the first choice for treatment of non-erosive reflux disease ( NERD ) .
OBJECTIVE	However , NERD is less sensitive to PPIs than erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) and the differences between PPIs and H@ receptor antagonists are less evident in NERD than in erosive GERD .
OBJECTIVE	Since gastric acid secretion is lower in the Japanese population than in Western populations , we aimed to investigate whether PPI therapy is really necessary for NERD patients in Japan .
METHODS	Thirty-three symptomatic endoscopically diagnosed NERD patients were randomly assigned to receive roxatidine acetate @ mg twice daily ( n = @ ) or omeprazole @ mg once daily ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale at baseline and after @ and @ weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	Both roxatidine and omeprazole significantly improved the heartburn score at @ and @ weeks .
RESULTS	The clinical response rates did not differ between roxatidine and omeprazole .
RESULTS	Both roxatidine and omeprazole significantly relieved not only reflux but also abdominal pain and indigestion .
RESULTS	The degrees of improvement did not differ between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Roxatidine relieved the symptoms of NERD patients with similar effectiveness to omeprazole .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , roxatidine may be a good choice for NERD treatment .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to generate composite measures quantifying a household 's obesogenic potential and to examine the relationship of the composite variables with older children 's eating , physical activity ( PA ) , and small screen recreation .
METHODS	Data were from surveys with @ child-parent pairs in which the child was in grade @ , @ , or @ ( mean age : @ years ) .
METHODS	Composite measures of the obesogenic household environment were generated from @ measures using nonlinear principal components analysis .
METHODS	Associations between the composite measures and the children 's healthy and unhealthy food intake , PA , and screen time were tested ( adjusting for demographic characteristics ) .
RESULTS	Two scales were generated : ( @ ) obesogenic control , which clustered together factors that mitigate risk ; and ( @ ) obesogenic risk .
RESULTS	Higher scores on the control scale were associated with higher adolescent intake of healthy foods , lower intake of unhealthy foods , higher PA , and less screen time .
RESULTS	Higher scores on the risk scale were associated with lower adolescent intake of healthy foods , higher intake of unhealthy foods , lower PA , and more screen time .
RESULTS	There were significant @-way interactions between the scales for soft drink consumption and PA. .
CONCLUSIONS	Household obesogenic potential may be quantified as @ factors reflecting cumulative risk and control practices .
CONCLUSIONS	These factors have both additive associations with obesogenic behaviors and , in some cases , modify each other , suggesting that a healthy home environment requires attention to both .
CONCLUSIONS	Health promotion messages could incorporate these @ different but interacting factors that parents can use to modify the obesogenic potential of their household .

BACKGROUND	Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) based self-help has been found to be effective for treating depression and anxiety .
BACKGROUND	There is some evidence to suggest that CBT needs to be culturally adapted for it to be effective in non-Western cultures .
BACKGROUND	CBT is not widely used in low and middle income countries and there is a need to test its effectiveness in different settings and formats , including self-help .
METHODS	We describe a RCT of a Culturally adapted CBT ( CaCBT ) based self-help manual in Pakistan .
METHODS	The trial was conducted in psychiatry departments in three cities .
METHODS	Assessments were carried out at baseline and at @ weeks , using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , Bradford somatic Inventory and brief disability Questionnaire .
RESULTS	At the end of the trial CaCBT based self-help was found to be effective against care as usual in reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety , as well as somatic symptoms and disability .
CONCLUSIONS	This study was conducted only in secondary care and required either patient or a carer to be able to read and write .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study outside West of a CBT based self-help intervention for depression .
CONCLUSIONS	This study highlights the importance of using cost effective interventions in developing world in low intensity formats .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should focus on trying these resources in different settings , like primary care , and with the use of audio/video or multimedia resources to improve compliance in patients with lower literacy .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate whether anticholinergic medication contributes to early recovery of continence and improvement of other voiding symptoms after radical prostatectomy ( RP ) .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who had incontinence at @ week after RP were enrolled prospectively .
METHODS	The patients were allocated to one of the @ groups : group @ ( - adrenergic agonist [ midodrine ] plus an anticholinergic [ solifenacin ] ) or group @ ( - adrenergic agonist only ) .
METHODS	A urodynamic study and the International Continence Society male Short Form questionnaire were completed preoperatively and @ months after RP .
METHODS	One-hour pad test and @-day frequency volume chart at @ and @ months after medication were also analyzed .
RESULTS	The rate of continence , defined as being pad free , did not differ between the groups at @ months ( both @ % ; P > @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the decreased value of mean weight of daily pads worn by groups @ and @ were @ vs @ g , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incontinence ( P = @ ) and quality of life ( P = @ ) subscale scores significantly worsened in group @ , whereas they remained unchanged in group @ .
RESULTS	Maximal detrusor pressure and maximal urethral closure pressure significantly decreased in both groups , whereas maximal cystometric capacity increased significantly in group @ only ( @-@ @ cm H@O ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Anticholinergics may facilitate early recovery from incontinence and prevent worsening of quality of life , which might be attributed to increased cystometric capacity after their use .

BACKGROUND	The carnitines exert neuroprotective and neuromodulatory actions , and carnitine supplementation increases locomotor activity ( LMA ) in experimental animals .
METHODS	We measured @ indexes of LMA and @ indexes of stereotypic activity ( STA ) in adult male and female caged mice .
METHODS	In a randomized @-week trial , @ males and @ females received @ mg/kg body weight PO l-carnitine , and another @ males and @ females received placebo .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo-treated females , placebo-treated males had a greater number of stereotypies ( NSTs ) , stereotypy counts ( STCs ) , stereotypy time ( STT ) , and right front time ( RFT ) , but smaller total distance traveled ( TDT ) , margin distance ( MD ) , number of vertical movements ( NVMs ) , and left rear time ( LRT ) .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo-treated males , carnitine-treated males had greater horizontal activity ( HA ) , movement time ( MT ) , NVM , STT , TDT , STC , MD , LRT , and clockwise revolutions ( CRs ) , but smaller left front time ( LFT ) and RFT .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo-treated females , carnitine-treated females had greater NST , STC , STT , LFT , and RFT , but smaller NM , HA , NVM , VA , MT , anticlockwise revolutions ( ACRs ) , CR , TDT , and MD ; right rear time ( RRT ) remained statistically insignificant across all comparisons .
CONCLUSIONS	In summary , l-carnitine caused gender differences to persist for STC , diminish for NST and STT , disappear for LRT and NVM , change in the opposite direction for TDT and MD , appear de novo for HA , VA , NM , MT , and LFT , and remain absent for RRT and ACR .
CONCLUSIONS	Some indexes of LMA and STA are sexually dimorphic in adult mice , and l-carnitine differentially maintains , diminishes/cancels , inverts , or creates the sexual dimorphism of particular indexes .

BACKGROUND	From an evidence-based point of view , correction of posterior crossbite is not sufficiently evaluated .
BACKGROUND	Thus , the aims of this study were to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment strategies to correct unilateral posterior crossbite in the mixed dentition by using the randomized clinical trial methodology with an untreated control group .
METHODS	Sixty patients participated in the study .
METHODS	All met the following inclusion criteria : mixed dentition , unilateral posterior crossbite , no sucking habits , and no previous orthodontic treatment .
METHODS	The patients were randomized into @ groups : quad-helix , expansion plate , composite onlay , and untreated control .
METHODS	The success rates , amounts of maxillary and mandibular expansion , and treatment times were registered .
RESULTS	The quad-helix appliance was superior to the expansion plate in success rate and treatment time .
RESULTS	Treatment with the expansion plate was unsuccessful in one third of the subjects .
RESULTS	Crossbite correction with composite onlay in the mixed dentition was ineffective , and spontaneous correction in the mixed dentition did not occur .
CONCLUSIONS	If unilateral posterior crossbite is planned to be corrected in the mixed dentition , this study clearly confirmed that treatment with the quad-helix is an appropriate and successful method .

METHODS	Secondary outcome measure was the prevalence of post interventional ECA occlusion .
RESULTS	Of @ patients enrolled in ICSS at our center , @ patients ( mean age , @ years ; @ males ) were included in the present study ( @ CAS , @ CEA ) .
RESULTS	Baseline PSV in the ipsilateral ECA was similar between the groups .
RESULTS	Following CAS , PSV gradually increased during follow-up , whereas PSV remained relatively stable after CEA ; mean difference of PSV between CAS and CEA : @ cm/s ( @ % CI , -@ to @ ) , @ cm/s ( @ % CI , @-@ ) , and @ cm/s ( @ % CI , @-@ ) at @ days , @ months , and @ months .
RESULTS	One new ECA occlusion occurred after CAS and two after CEA .
CONCLUSIONS	Blood flow velocities in the ipsilateral ECA increase significantly after CAS but not after CEA .
CONCLUSIONS	However , this does not lead to a higher rate of ECA occlusion in the first @ years after revascularization .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that CAS is not inferior to CEA in preserving the ECA as a possible potential collateral pathway for cerebral blood supply within @ years following revascularization .
