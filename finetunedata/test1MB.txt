BACKGROUND	Adrenergic activation is thought to be an important determinant of outcome in subjects with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but baseline or serial changes in adrenergic activity have not been previously investigated in a large patient sample treated with a powerful antiadrenergic agent .
RESULTS	Systemic venous norepinephrine was measured at baseline , @ months , and @ months in the beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial ( BEST ) , which compared placebo treatment with the beta-blocker/sympatholytic agent bucindolol .
RESULTS	Baseline norepinephrine level was associated with a progressive increase in rates of death or death plus CHF hospitalization that was independent of treatment group .
RESULTS	On multivariate analysis , baseline norepinephrine was also a highly significant ( P < @ ) independent predictor of death .
RESULTS	In contrast , the relation of the change in norepinephrine at @ months to subsequent clinical outcomes was complex and treatment group-dependent .
RESULTS	In the placebo-treated group but not in the bucindolol-treated group , marked norepinephrine increase at @ months was associated with increased subsequent risks of death or death plus CHF hospitalization .
RESULTS	In the bucindolol-treated group but not in the placebo-treated group , the @st quartile of marked norepinephrine reduction was associated with an increased mortality risk .
RESULTS	A likelihood-based method indicated that @ % of the bucindolol group but only @ % of the placebo group were at an increased risk for death related to marked reduction in norepinephrine at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	In BEST , a subset of patients treated with bucindolol had an increased risk of death as the result of sympatholysis , which compromised the efficacy of this third-generation beta-blocker .

OBJECTIVE	The study evaluated the effectiveness of a three-year outpatient commitment pilot program established in @ at Bellevue Hospital in New York City .
METHODS	A total of @ participants were randomly assigned ; @ received court-ordered treatment , which included enhanced services , and @ received the enhanced-service package only .
METHODS	Between @ and @ percent of the subjects completed interviews at one , five , and @ months after hospital discharge .
METHODS	Outcome measures included rehospitalization , arrest , quality of life , symptomatology , treatment noncompliance , and perceived level of coercion .
RESULTS	On all major outcome measures , no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups .
RESULTS	No subject was arrested for a violent crime .
RESULTS	Eighteen percent of the court-ordered group and @ percent of the control group were arrested at least once .
RESULTS	The percentage rehospitalized during follow-up was about the same for both groups-@ percent and @ percent , respectively .
RESULTS	The groups did not differ significantly in the total number of days hospitalized during the follow-up period .
RESULTS	Participants ' perceptions of their quality of life and level of coercion were about the same .
RESULTS	From the community service providers ' perspective , patients in the two groups were similarly adherent to their required treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	All results must be qualified by the fact that no pick-up order procedures for noncompliant subjects in the court-ordered group were implemented during the study , which compromised the differences between the conditions for the two groups , and that persons with a history of violence were excluded from the program .

OBJECTIVE	Octylcyanoacrylate ( Dermabond ) is a tissue `` glue '' useful in closing surgical skin incisions .
OBJECTIVE	We compared skin octylcyanoacrylate with subcuticular skin sutures to close laparoscopic trocar sites .
METHODS	A randomized double-armed study was performed with @ patients in whom @ trocar sites were closed .
METHODS	Twenty-nine patients underwent subcuticular closure with @-@ absorbable suture , and thirty patients received closure with octylcyanoacrylate in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer ( Ethicon ; Somerville , NJ ) .
METHODS	The number of sutures or vials of octylcyanoacrylate used , closure times , and postoperative wound problems were recorded .
METHODS	Wounds were assessed @ weeks postoperatively for healing complications .
METHODS	Closure costs were estimated using published operating room time per hour plus the cost of octylcyanoacrylate or suture .
METHODS	Student 's paired t-test was used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	The overall mean time required for skin closure using octylcyanoacrylate and suture was @ minutes and @ minutes , respectively ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	An average of @ packets of suture were used to close all port sites in a particular patient , while closure with octylcyanoacrylate required an average of @ vials per patient .
RESULTS	Wound complications consisted of subcuticular seroma with skin separation and were equally common in the two groups .
RESULTS	The overall average cost per closure using octylcyanoacrylate was $ @ US dollars , while the cost for closure using suture was $ @ US dollars ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Laparoscopic port-site skin closure with octylcyanoacrylate is rapid and effective .
CONCLUSIONS	The method yields cost savings and a decrease in operative time of more than @ minutes per case .

BACKGROUND	Glucose and insulin levels are associated with left ventricular mass ( LVM ) in insulin-resistant individuals .
BACKGROUND	Antihypertensive drugs have different effects on glucose and insulin metabolism ( GIM ) and on LVM .
BACKGROUND	To evaluate whether the effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVM are associated with its effects on GIM , we compared the effects of atenolol and perindopril on these parameters in a group of insulin-resistant , obese hypertensives .
RESULTS	A total of @ obese , nondiabetic hypertensives who were aged @ + / -@ years , had a body mass index of @ + / -@ kg/m ( @ ) , were free of coronary or valvular heart disease , and had normal LV function were randomized to treatment with atenolol ( n = @ ) or perindopril ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Echocardiographic LVM corrected for height ( LVM/height ) and GIM ( @-hour intravenous glucose tolerance test ) were measured after @ to @ weeks of washout and @ months of treatment .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	Atenolol and perindopril effectively reduced blood pressure ( from @ + / -@ / @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ / @ + / -@ mm Hg and from @ + / -@ / @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ / @ + / -@ mm Hg , respectively , for the atenolol and perindopril groups ; P : = @ ) .
RESULTS	Atenolol significantly worsened GIM parameters , fasting glucose levels ( @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ mmol/L ; P : = @ ) , fasting insulin levels ( @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ pmol/L ; P : = @ ) , and most other relevant metabolic measures ( P : < @ for all ) .
RESULTS	Perindopril did not affect GIM .
RESULTS	Atenolol did not affect LVM/height ( @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ g/m ; P : = @ ) , whereas perindopril significantly reduced LVM/height ( @ + / -@ to @ + / -@ g/m ; P : = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In obese , hypertensive individuals , adequate and similar blood pressure control was achieved with perindopril and atenolol .
CONCLUSIONS	However , perindopril but not atenolol was associated with a more favorable GIM profile and led to a significant regression of LVM .

OBJECTIVE	The goal of the study was to assess semantic priming to emotion and nonemotion cue words using a novel measure of associational breadth for participants who either took rapid eye movement ( REM ) or nonrapid eye movement ( NREM ) naps or who remained awake ; assess relation of priming to REM sleep consolidation and REM sleep inertia effects .
METHODS	The associational breadth task was applied in both a priming condition , where cue-words were signaled to be memorized prior to sleep ( primed ) , and a nonpriming condition , where cue words were not memorized ( nonprimed ) .
METHODS	Cue words were either emotional ( positive , negative ) or nonemotional .
METHODS	Participants were randomly assigned to either an awake ( WAKE ) or a sleep condition , which was subsequently split into NREM or REM groups depending on stage at awakening .
METHODS	Hospital-based sleep laboratory .
METHODS	Fifty-eight healthy participants ( @ male ) ages @ to @ y ( Mage = @ @ y ) .
RESULTS	The REM group scored higher than the NREM or WAKE groups on primed , but not nonprimed emotional cue words ; the effect was stronger for positive than for negative cue words .
RESULTS	However , REM time and percent correlated negatively with degree of emotional priming .
RESULTS	Priming occurred for REM awakenings but not for NREM awakenings , even when the latter sleep episodes contained some REM sleep .
CONCLUSIONS	Associational breadth may be selectively consolidated during REM sleep for stimuli that have been tagged as important for future memory retrieval .
CONCLUSIONS	That priming decreased with REM time and was higher only for REM sleep awakenings is consistent with two explanatory REM sleep processes : REM sleep consolidation serving emotional downregulation and REM sleep inertia .

OBJECTIVE	Quality of bowel cleansing significantly increases the shorter the time between bowel solution intake and endoscopic examination .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the efficacy and patient tolerability following a modified polyethylene glycol electrolyte ( PEG ) splitting regimen .
METHODS	This was a prospective , single-blind , randomized , study .
METHODS	Patients were assigned to receive either PEG @ L the afternoon before colonoscopy or PEG @ L the day before and @ L @h before the procedure the day of colonoscopy .
RESULTS	The study population consisted of @ patients , including @ participants in each study arm .
RESULTS	Although the bowel preparation quality was similarly quoted as excellent/good following the split and full regimen ( @ % vs @ % ; p = @ ) , a significant ( p < @ ) shift from good towards an excellent preparation ( @ % vs @ % ) was observed following the split regimen as compared to the full regimen ( @ % vs @ % ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of side-effects did not differ .
RESULTS	When patients were asked about a future preparation if needed , @ % and @ % following the split and full regimen , respectively , declared to accept again the same preparation , the difference being statistically significant ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data found that an excellent bowel cleansing could be frequently achieved by simply modifying the split regimen from the standard PEG @ plus @ L to @ plus @ L.

OBJECTIVE	The objective of our study was to define the interaction between either unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) or a low molecular weight heparin , reviparin ( REV ) , and the pharmacodynamic profile of the GPIIb/IIIa-antagonists abciximab ( ABC ) or tirofiban ( T ) .
METHODS	Two studies each containing @ healthy subjects were performed , and all were pretreated with aspirin ( ASA ) for @ days .
METHODS	Volunteers then received UFH ( @ IU bolus/infusion @ IU kg ( -@ ) h ( -@ ) for @ h , n = @ ) , REV ( @-anti-Xa-IU s.c. , n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	One hour later , ABC ( study I ) or T ( study II ) were given by i.v. infusion for @ h.
METHODS	The pharmacodynamic effects measured were bleeding time ( BT ) , fibrinogen-binding at the GPIIb/IIIa-receptor ( FIB ) , expression of the platelet secretion marker CD@ , and ADP ( @ microM ) - and collagen ( @ microg ml ( -@ ) ) - induced platelet aggregation .
RESULTS	After treatment with both GPIIb/IIIa-antagonists , prolongation of BT occurred to a similar magnitude ( approximately @-@ min ) and was not affected by UFH or REV-comedication .
RESULTS	ABC or T with ASA alone resulted in nearly the same magnitude of reduction in FIB and platelet aggregation .
RESULTS	After coadministration with UFH , FIB was significantly higher ( thus less inhibited ) than after after T + ASA alone ( @ + / - @ % vs @ + / - @ % ) or ABC + ASA alone ( @ + / - @ % vs @ + / - @ % ) .
RESULTS	This attenuation of FIB was not seen with REV. Inhibition of ADP-and collagen-induced aggregation tended to be attenuated by treatment with UFH ( e.g. ADP-induced aggregation at @ h after ABC + ASA alone = @ + / - @ % ; after coadministration with UFH = @ + / - @ % ) .
RESULTS	No such changes were noted with REV. Minor reductions in CD@-expression were seen in subjects given ABC or T alone , but expression was not affected by UFH or REV.
CONCLUSIONS	Co-medication with UFH attenuated platelet inhibition during treatment with GPIIb/IIIa-antagonists , but these effects were not seen with the low molecular weight heparin reviparin .
CONCLUSIONS	The results show that administration of reviparin together with abciximab or tirofiban did not adversely affect the pharmacodynamic profile of these GPIIb/IIIa-antagonists .

###21323269
OBJECTIVE	To compare functional and morphological outcomes of @-mm versus @-mm microincision coaxial cataract surgery ( MCCS ) .
METHODS	Thirty eyes of @ patients that underwent MCCS were randomized to two groups : @-mm MCCS ( group @ : @ eyes ) and @-mm MCCS ( group @ : @ eyes ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant between-group differences in uncorrected visual acuity , best-corrected visual acuity , keratometric astigmatism , and endothelial cell count .
RESULTS	One day postoperatively , a greater increase of corneal thickness at the incision site was observed in group @ compared to group @ using anterior segment optical coherence tomography with no significant differences in tunnel morphometric features and confocal microscopy showed more tunnel edema in group @ versus group @ that resolved in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Both @ - and @-mm torsional MCCS were safe and efficient with easy surgical maneuvers and excellent functional and morphological results ; @-mm MCCS induced slightly greater tunnel edema shortly after surgery that resolved in the medium term .

OBJECTIVE	There are safety issues associated with propofol use for flexible bronchoscopy ( FB ) .
OBJECTIVE	The bispectral index ( BIS ) correlates well with the level of consciousness .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to show that BIS-guided propofol infusion is safe and may provide better sedation , benefiting the patients and bronchoscopists .
METHODS	After administering alfentanil bolus , @ patients were randomized to either propofol infusion titrated to a BIS level of @-@ ( study group ) or incremental midazolam bolus based on clinical judgment to achieve moderate sedation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was safety , while the secondary endpoints were recovery time , patient tolerance , and cooperation .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients with hypoxemia or hypotensive events were not different in the @ groups ( study vs. control groups : @ % vs. @ % , p = @ ; @ % vs. @ % , p = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The mean lowest blood pressure was lower in the study group .
RESULTS	Logistic regression revealed male gender , higher American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status , and electrocautery were associated with hypoxemia , whereas lower propofol dose for induction was associated with hypotension in the study group .
RESULTS	The study group had better global tolerance ( p < @ ) , less procedural interference by movement or cough ( @ % vs. @ % , p < @ ; @ % vs. @ % , p = @ , respectively ) , and shorter time to orientation and ambulation ( @ min vs. @ min , p < @ ; @ min vs. @ min , p < @ , respectively ) compared to the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	BIS-guided propofol infusion combined with alfentanil for FB sedation provides excellent patient tolerance , with fast recovery and less procedure interference .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the long-term effects of estrogen replacement therapy on sex hormone binding globuline ( SHBG ) and free testosterone ( fT ) levels in surgical postmenopausal women .
METHODS	Forty patients with surgical menopause were enrolled in this prospective study .
METHODS	The women were randomly divided into two groups .
METHODS	The first group received oral therapy ( continuous conjugated equine estrogens ( CEE ) - @ mg per day ) and the second group received transdermal therapy ( patches delivering continuous @beta-estradiol ( E@ ) -- @ mg per day ) .
METHODS	Serum SHBG and fT levels were determined at baseline and after first and second years of treatment .
METHODS	Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc test and unpaired-t-test were performed for statistical analysis with SPSS program .
RESULTS	Serum SHBG levels increased significantly with oral CEE after first year of treatment ( P < @ ) and remained at this level for the next year .
RESULTS	Transdermal therapy did not affect SHBG levels after first and second years ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum fT levels did not change significantly in either group at the end of the first or second years ( P < @ ) although there was a significant difference between the groups after @ years ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Oral conjugated estrogens increased SHBG levels during therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	This effect may balance the increased estrogen and androgen stimulation on breast tissue and may be more beneficial to the cardiovascular system in postmenopausal women .

OBJECTIVE	Previous studies of monochromatic visual evoked potentials confirm the strong suppression of ( the cortical representation of ) paracentral retinal areas of functionally amblyopic eyes , by a flat response to a blue stimulus .
OBJECTIVE	A clinical trial stimulating these areas with blue light was encouraging , and justified a prospective comparison of this treatment with conventional classic treatment .
METHODS	In @ strabismic children with amblyopia , the blue filter treatment protocol ( flash stimulation with , and the wearing of , a blue filter during occlusion of the better eye for one hour daily ) was compared with the classical treatment ( full time total occlusion by patch ) in a prospective matched and randomized study .
METHODS	Patients @ to @ years old without previous treatment and a visual acuity up to @ were admitted to the study .
METHODS	Visual acuity and fixation behavior were used as the parameters of comparison .
METHODS	Visual Evoked Potentials by monochromatic flashes were also studied .
METHODS	Results of treatment were compared after @ months .
RESULTS	The visual acuity outcome for the blue filter treatment was `` statistically significantly '' better ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The greatest improvement was seen in the subgroup of children with eccentric fixation ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fixation behavior also showed a better outcome from the blue filter treatment ( p = @ ) favoring especially children between @ and @ years .
RESULTS	In children of this age with a visual acuity better than @ we found a very `` statistically significant '' difference between the two treatments ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In children @ to @ years old with poorer visual acuity we also found a `` statistically significant '' difference in the two treatments ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The interocular difference of amplitude on the Visual Evoked Potentials also demonstrated more improvement in children treated with the blue filter .
RESULTS	This treatment improved especially the cortical response to blue flash stimulation , correlating to paracentral retinal areas .
CONCLUSIONS	The blue filter treatment protocol provided better results for treating amblyopia than the conventional classic occlusion treatment method .
CONCLUSIONS	We propose that stimulation of these paracentral retinal areas triggers a better disinhibition of a functionally amblyopic eye .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral treatment with the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid ( ALA ) in NIDDM patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy ( CAN ) , assessed by heart rate variability ( HRV ) .
METHODS	In a randomized , double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter trial ( Deutsche Kardiale Autonome Neuropathie [ DEKAN ] Study ) , NIDDM patients with reduced HRV were randomly assigned to treatment with daily oral dose of @ mg ALA ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	Parameters of HRV at rest included the coefficient of variation ( CV ) , root mean square successive difference ( RMSSD ) , and spectral power in the low-frequency ( LF ; @-@ @ Hz ) and high-frequency ( HF ; @-@ @ Hz ) bands .
METHODS	In addition , cardiovascular autonomic symptoms were assessed .
RESULTS	Seventeen patients dropped out of the study ( ALA n = @ ; placebo n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean blood pressure and HbA@ levels did not differ between the groups at baseline and during the study , but heart rate at baseline was higher in the group treated with ALA ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	RMSSD increased from baseline to @ months by @ ms ( -@ to @ ) [ median ( minimum-maximum ) ] in the group given ALA and decreased by -@ ms ( -@ to @ ) in the placebo group ( P < @ for ALA vs. placebo ) .
RESULTS	Power spectrum in the LF band increased by @ bpm@ ( -@ to @ ) in ALA , whereas it declined by -@ bpm@ ( -@ to @ ) in placebo ( P < @ for ALA vs. placebo ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , there was a trend toward a favorable effect of ALA versus placebo for the CV and HF band power spectrum ( P = @ and P = @ for ALA vs. placebo ) .
RESULTS	The changes in cardiovascular autonomic symptoms did not differ significantly between the groups during the period studied .
RESULTS	No differences between the groups were noted regarding the rates of adverse events .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that treatment with ALA using a well-tolerated oral dose of @ mg/day for @ months may slightly improve CAN in NIDDM patients .

BACKGROUND	Implants were first designed to be used in the reconstruction of edentulous mandibles .
BACKGROUND	However , with the technological advancement , enormous changes were made to improve the implant design and surface characteristics leading to the wide use of implants in the replacement of missing teeth .
BACKGROUND	During the transition from an edentulous span to a fixed prosthesis , narrow body implants ( NBIs ) have been proposed to enhance patient comfort and function .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , this study was aimed at investigating the survival and success rates of NBIs used for supporting immediately nonfunctional loaded provisional fixed partial denture ( PFPD ) .
METHODS	Either @ - or @-mm-diameter dental implants were placed transmucosally into the edentulous ridges of @ partially edentulous patients .
METHODS	PFPD of self-cured bis-acryl composite material were made using either a vacuform template chairside or a relined prefabricated PFPD .
METHODS	Occlusal adjustments were made to ensure that there was no functional loading on the provisional restorations before they were secured onto the transitional implants .
RESULTS	At @ year , the implant success and survival rates were @ % and @ % , respectively , with a mean percentage of bone loss of @ % ( @ % -@ % ) and a mean bone loss of @ mm ( range : @-@ @ mm ) .
CONCLUSIONS	With a favorable implant survival rate , the use of NBIs to support provisional restorations seemed to be a feasible treatment option .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , there is merit for research on the long-term use of NBIs-supported final prostheses .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the efficacy of rizatriptan @-mg orally disintegrating tablet ( ODT ) for treating migraines of mild intensity soon after onset , with or without patient-specific migraine education .
BACKGROUND	Studies have shown rizatriptan tablet efficacy in early migraine treatment .
METHODS	In this randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blind , factorial design study , adults with a history of migraine were assigned to rizatriptan @-mg ODT patient education ( personalized summary of early migraine signs and symptoms ) or placebo patient education in a @ : @ : @ : @ ratio .
METHODS	Patients were instructed to treat @ attack at the earliest time they knew that their headache was a migraine , while pain was mild .
METHODS	During the next @ hours , patients assessed pain severity , associated symptoms , functional disability , use of rescue medication , and treatment satisfaction .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was pain freedom at @ hours ; a key secondary endpoint was @-hour sustained pain freedom .
RESULTS	Of @ patients randomized to treatment , @ ( @ % ) treated a study migraine .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients taking rizatriptan reported pain freedom at @ hours compared with placebo ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , significantly more patients taking rizatriptan reported @-hour sustained pain freedom ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	A greater proportion of patients in the rizatriptan + education group reported pain freedom at @ hours compared with those in the rizatriptan + no education group ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Few adverse events were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Rizatriptan @-mg ODT , when taken early , while headache pain is mild , was superior to placebo at providing pain freedom at @ hours and @-hour sustained pain freedom .

OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to determine whether students who are trained in developing a personal formulary become more competent in rational prescribing than students who have only learned to use existing formularies .
METHODS	This was a multicentre , randomised , controlled study conducted in eight universities in India , Indonesia , the Netherlands , the Russian Federation , Slovakia , South Africa , Spain and Yemen .
METHODS	Five hundred and eighty-three medical students were randomised into three groups : the personal formulary group ( PF ; @ ) , the existing formulary group ( EF ; @ ) and the control group ( C ; @ ) .
METHODS	The PF group was taught how to develop and use a personal formulary , whereas e the EF group was taught how to review and use an existing formulary .
METHODS	The C group received no additional training and participated only in the tests .
METHODS	Student 's prescribing skills were measured by scoring their treatment plans for written patient cases .
RESULTS	The mean PF group score increased by @ % compared with @ % for the EF group ( p < @ ) and @ % for controls ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The positive effect of PF training was only significant in universities that had a mainly classic curriculum .
CONCLUSIONS	Training in development and use of a personal formulary was particularly effective in universities with a classic curriculum and with traditional pharmacology teaching .
CONCLUSIONS	In universities with a general problem-based curriculum , pharmacotherapy teaching can be based on either existing or personal formularies .

OBJECTIVE	While tamoxifen has been shown to alter concentration of many hormones and their binding globulins , there have been conflicting results regarding its effects on thyroid function tests .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to clarify these effects by studying subjects in a controlled clinical trial .
METHODS	We evaluated a subset of postmenopausal women who had participated in a longitudinal , double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled toxicity study of tamoxifen @ mg orally , twice daily .
METHODS	There were @ subjects in both the tamoxifen and placebo groups .
METHODS	Measurement of thyroid-binding globulin ( TBG ) , thyroxine uptake ( T-Uptake ) , thyroxine ( T@ ) , and thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , and an indirect estimate of the free T@ index ( FTI ) , were made for each subject before and after @ months of treatment .
RESULTS	For T-Uptake , T@ , and TBG , there were significant increases in the mean change from baseline to @ months in the tamoxifen group compared with the placebo group ( P = @ , @ , and @ , respectively ) , while there were no significant changes in the measured TSH and in the calculated FTI .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women results in increased TBG , with secondary increases in measured T-Uptake and T@ following .
CONCLUSIONS	However , TSH and FTI levels are unchanged , and treated women remain eumetabolic .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the bioequivalence of @ oral isotretinoin ( @ mg ) soft gel capsule formulations .
OBJECTIVE	The reference preparation was Roaccutan/Roche while the test preparation was A-Cnotren/Pharmaten , Athens , Greece .
METHODS	The study was an open , randomized , @-period , @-sequence , @-treatment crossover , involving @ healthy male volunteer subjects .
METHODS	All volunteers completed the study .
METHODS	Isotretinoin plasma concentrations were measured by a fully validated HPLC method .
METHODS	Special care was taken through the collection and analysis of the samples due to instability of isotretinoin to light and temperature .
METHODS	Pharmacokinetic parameters used to assess bioequivalence were AUC ( @-last ) , AUC ( @-infinity ) for the extent of absorption and Cmax and Tmax for the rate of absorption .
METHODS	Statistical evaluation of Cmax , AUC ( @-last ) , AUC ( @-infinity ) was done after semi-logarithmic transformation by @-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) .
METHODS	Tmax values were tested using the distribution-free Hodges-Lehman interval .
RESULTS	The parametric @ % confidence intervals for ratio T/R ranged from @-@ @ % ( point estimate @ % ) for AUC ( @-last ) , @-@ @ % ( point estimate @ % ) for AUC ( @-infinity ) and @-@ @ % ( point estimate @ % ) for Cmax , respectively .
RESULTS	Based on the results of Tmax , k ( el ) and t ( @/@ ) , too , there were no statistically significant differences .
CONCLUSIONS	As a result , the @ isotretinoin preparations in accordance with the European Union bioequivalence requirements , are equivalent with respect to rate and extent of absorption .

BACKGROUND	Men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer ( LPC ) can choose from multiple treatment regimens and are faced with a decision in which medical factors and personal preferences are important .
BACKGROUND	The Personal Patient Profile-Prostate ( P@P ) is a computerized decision aid for men with LPC that focuses on personal preferences .
BACKGROUND	We determined whether the P@P intervention improved the concordance of treatment choice with self-reported influential side-effects compared with a control group .
METHODS	English/Spanish-speaking men diagnosed with LPC ( @-@ ) from four US cities were enrolled into a randomized trial and followed through @-months via mailed or online questionnaire .
METHODS	Men were randomized to receive the P@P intervention or standard education plus links to reputable websites .
METHODS	We classified choice as concordant if men were concerned with ( a ) sexual function and chose external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy , ( b ) bowel function and chose prostatectomy , ( c ) sex , bowel , and/or bladder function and chose active surveillance , or ( d ) not concerned with any side effect and chose any treatment .
METHODS	Using logistic regression , we calculated odds ratios ( OR ) and @ % confidence intervals ( CI ) for the association between the P@P intervention and concordance .
RESULTS	Of @ men , most were < @ years , non-Hispanic white , had multiple physician consultations prior to enrollment , and chose a treatment discordant with concerns about potential side effects .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in concordance between the intervention ( @ % ) and control ( @ % ) group ( OR = @ ; @ % CI = @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The P@P intervention did not improve concordance between potential side effects and treatment choice .
CONCLUSIONS	Information and/or physician consultation immediately after diagnosis was likely to influence decisions despite concerns about side effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention may be more effective before the first treatment options consultation .

BACKGROUND	Simulation-based learning is a common educational tool in health care training and frequently involves instructional designs based on Experiential Learning Theory ( ELT ) .
BACKGROUND	However , little research explores the effectiveness and efficiency of different instructional design methodologies appropriate for simulations .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare @ instructional design models , ELT and Guided Experiential Learning ( GEL ) , to determine which is more effective for training the central venous catheterization procedure .
METHODS	Using a quasi-experimental randomized block design , nurse anesthetists completed training under @ of the @ instructional design models .
METHODS	Performance was assessed using a checklist of central venous catheterization performance , pass rates , and critical action errors .
RESULTS	Participants in the GEL condition performed significantly better than those in the ELT condition on the overall checklist score after controlling for individual practice time ( F [ @ , @ ] = @ , P = @ , Cohen 's d = @ ) , had higher pass rates ( P = @ , Cohen 's d = @ ) , and had lower rates of failure due to critical action errors ( P = @ , Cohen 's d = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The GEL model of instructional design is significantly more effective than ELT for simulation-based learning of the central venous catheterization procedure , yielding large differences in effect size .

BACKGROUND	Depression is a worldwide problem warranting global solutions to tackle it .
BACKGROUND	Enhancing well-being has benefits in its own right and could be a good strategy for preventing depression .
BACKGROUND	Providing well-being interventions via the Internet may have synergetic effects .
OBJECTIVE	Psyfit ( `` mental fitness online '' ) is a fully automated self-help intervention to improve well-being based on positive psychology .
OBJECTIVE	This study examines the clinical effects of this intervention .
METHODS	We conducted a @-armed randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of access to Psyfit for @ months ( n = @ ) to a waiting-list control condition ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Mild to moderately depressed adults in the general population seeking self-help were recruited .
METHODS	Primary outcome was well-being measured by Mental Health Continuum-Short Form ( MHC-SF ) and WHO Well-being Index ( WHO-@ ) ; secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms , anxiety , vitality , and general health measured by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ( CES-D ) , Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale ( HADS-A ) , and Medical Outcomes Study-Short Form ( MOS-SF ) vitality and general health subscales , respectively .
METHODS	Online measurements were taken at baseline , @ months , and @ months after baseline .
RESULTS	The dropout rate was @ % in the Psyfit group and @ % in the control group .
RESULTS	At @-month follow-up , Psyfit tended to be more effective in enhancing well-being ( nonsignificantly for MHC-SF : Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ; significantly for WHO-@ : Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) , compared to the waiting-list control group .
RESULTS	For the secondary outcomes , small but significant effects were found for general health ( Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) , vitality ( d = @ , P = @ ) , anxiety symptoms ( Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) , and depressive symptoms ( Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @-month follow-up , there were no significant effects on well-being ( MHC-SF : Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ; WHO-@ : Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) , whereas depressive symptoms ( Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) and anxiety symptoms ( Cohen 's d = @ , P = @ ) were still significantly reduced compared to the control group .
RESULTS	There was no clear dose-response relationship between adherence and effectiveness , although some significant differences appeared across most outcomes in favor of those completing at least @ lesson in the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that an online well-being intervention can effectively enhance well-being ( at least in the short-term and for @ well-being measure ) and can help to reduce anxiety and depression symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research should focus on increasing adherence and motivation , reaching and serving lower-educated people , and widening the target group to include people with different levels of depressive symptoms .

OBJECTIVE	New national and state preventive health investments have provided significant funding for local governments ( LGs ) to be involved in planning and implementing health promotion interventions .
OBJECTIVE	There is an expectation that this work is evidence based ; however , inadequate support and systems exist for evidence-informed planning and decision making in LGs .
OBJECTIVE	Previous initiatives have aimed to build capacity and leadership in LG health promotion , but the training , support and infrastructure have been sporadic .
METHODS	Across @-@ we implemented a National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia ( NHMRC ) - funded university-LG research project to explore the feasibility , usefulness and outcomes of a knowledge translation ( KT ) intervention to increase the use of evidence in LGs .
METHODS	Within this exploratory cluster randomised controlled trial , one strategy being evaluated was workforce capacity building , during which group discussions revealed contextual challenges in delivering evidence-informed health promotion within the current funding context .
METHODS	Discussion was recorded .
METHODS	The group acknowledged the need to identify barriers and realistic practical solutions , and to communicate these more broadly .
RESULTS	Barriers to sourcing and applying evidence to inform health promotion emerged from discussions with LG representatives .
RESULTS	System-level contextual factors affecting decisions were also discussed , namely concerns about organisational capacity and ` culture ' to plan , implement and evaluate effective initiatives in LGs .
RESULTS	Possible solutions suggested included : systems for access to academic literature ; processes that make it easier to use evidence ; training in evidence-informed health promotion to build organisational culture and capacity ; and research-practice partnerships and mentoring .
CONCLUSIONS	Targeted strategies with individuals ( LG staff ) and organisations ( leadership , systems ) are needed to realise the potential of current health promotion investments .
CONCLUSIONS	Research-practice partnerships are likely to be important .
CONCLUSIONS	It seems obvious that it is impossible to be evidence informed without mechanisms to access and apply evidence .
CONCLUSIONS	We invite other LGs to reflect upon their experiences in such initiatives , and to consider whether the strategies we propose may be useful .
CONCLUSIONS	So what ?
CONCLUSIONS	The increased emphasis on health promotion and non-communicable disease prevention programs may be limited by the capacity , confidence and organisational culture to inform policies and programs with best-available evidence .
CONCLUSIONS	We describe some of the current challenges and contextual factors as they are being experienced .
CONCLUSIONS	There are opportunities for national and state governments , organisations representing local government ( e.g. municipal associations ) and research partners to provide targeted support to councils .
CONCLUSIONS	This may assist in achieving effective health promotion at the community level .

OBJECTIVE	Recent research offers conflicting views of whether women high in dietary restraint are inspired or demoralized after viewing thin-ideal images .
OBJECTIVE	We conducted two studies to explore the impact of diet commercials featuring the thin-ideal image on snack food consumption .
METHODS	In Study @ , @ high school women watched a sad movie interrupted with diet or neutral commercials .
METHODS	In Study @ , @ college women saw diet commercials early or midway through a sad movie .
RESULTS	In Study @ , high restraint participants consumed more snacks after exposure to diet commercials than to neutral commercials .
RESULTS	In Study @ , early commercials reduced snacking in low restraint women but not in high restraint women .
CONCLUSIONS	Thin-ideal images embedded in diet commercials do not inspire high restraint women but can modify the eating of low restraint women .

BACKGROUND	This prospective , randomized , double-blind , multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of Celecoxib and GCSB-@ , a new product from extracts of six herbs , for the treatment of knee osteoarthritis .
METHODS	A total of @ eligible patients were randomly assigned to the Celecoxib group ( n = @ patients ) or the GCSB-@ group ( n = @ patients ) for the @-week study .
METHODS	The amount of change and percentage of the change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities ( WOMAC ) Arthritis Index from the baseline , the change in pain on walking by visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , physician 's global assessment on response to therapy ( PGART ) by five point Likert scale , and the amount of rescue medicine taken were used as parameters for efficacy .
METHODS	Adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) were carefully investigated .
RESULTS	The WOMAC score improved in both the Celecoxib group and GCSB-@ group by @ and @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of the change in WOMAC score were -@ % and -@ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The pain VAS score decreased by @ and @ ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The responders by PGART were @ % and @ % ( P = @ ) , and the median amount of rescue medicine taken were @ and @ tablets ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of ADRs were @ % and @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The most common ADRs were gastrointestinal system related ; @ % in GCSB-@ group and @ % in Celecoxib group .
RESULTS	Any severe ADR was not observed in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	The result of this study supports that GCSB-@ is comparable to Celecoxib in terms of the efficacy and safety for the treatment of osteoarthritis of knee joint .

BACKGROUND	Epinephrine is a commonly used vasoconstrictor for instillation or infiltration to limit bleeding and improve the quality of the surgical field in functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) .
BACKGROUND	No study to date has shown the efficacy of varying concentrations of adrenaline wicks into the nasal mucosa during FESS .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , double-blind pilot study was conducted in which @ American Society of Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) class I and II patients aged @ to @ years were divided into two groups .
METHODS	Patients in group @ and @ received @ and @ mg of epinephrine , respectively , with a nasal pack soaked in @ mL of saline for @ minutes before surgery after induction of anesthesia .
METHODS	A standard anesthesia protocol was followed using morphine , propofol , vecuronium with oxygen , and nitrous oxide .
METHODS	Patients were monitored for assessment of the surgical field and the amount of blood loss during FESS .
METHODS	Patients were also monitored for heart rate , invasive blood pressure , and cardiac output to assess the safety of varying concentrations of adrenaline wicks .
METHODS	Blood loss was measured meticulously .
METHODS	The surgical field was assessed by a surgeon blinded to the patient group using the Boezaart scale .
METHODS	Hemodynamic instability ( @ % of baseline values ) was treated by rescue drugs ( nitroglycerin infusion , metoprolol ) .
RESULTS	Blood loss was found to be significantly decreased in group @ compared to group @ ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The rescue medication requirement to treat hypertension was more in group @ than in group @ ( p < @ ) but within the recommended limits .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in cardiac output between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	High-concentration ( @ mg in @ mL of saline ) adrenaline wicks used during FESS significantly improve the quality of the surgical field and decrease blood loss compared to low-concentration ( @ mg in @ mL saline ) wicks .
CONCLUSIONS	Associated hemodynamic changes can be controlled in both groups without significant clinical consequences .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the impact of intraoperative distal vasal flushing during no-scalpel vasectomy on hastening the sperm clearance from the vas deferens and subsequent postvasectomy time to azoospermia .
METHODS	A total of @ men undergoing vasectomy at our center from October @ to August @ were included in this prospective , randomized , controlled study .
METHODS	Patients were alternately allocated to @ of @ groups .
METHODS	Group A were patients who underwent no scalpel vasectomy alone ; Group B patients , in addition to no scalpel vasectomy , underwent flushing of the distal vasal segment with @ mL of sterile water .
METHODS	Postvasectomy semen analysis was done at @ , @ , and @ weeks .
METHODS	The age , operative time , number of ejaculations , and proportion of patients ' azoospermic at @ , @ , and @ weeks after vasectomy were compared between the @ groups .
RESULTS	A total of @ men were available for final analysis .
RESULTS	A significantly higher proportion of patients in group B were azoospermic at @ and @ weeks when compared with group A ( group B : @ % and @ % ; group A : @ % and @ % at @ and @ weeks , respectively ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in the mean age , operative time , and number of ejaculations between the @ groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Distal vasal flushing with @ mL of sterile water may shorten the time to azoospermia for between @ % and @ % of vasectomy patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , this procedure may be an option for some who choose the vasal flush to avoid the long duration of postvasectomy alternate contraceptive methods .

OBJECTIVE	To observe the effect of acupuncture stimulation of scalp - and body-acupoints on limb function in subacute stroke patients .
METHODS	A total of @ stroke inpatients were randomly and equally divided into acupuncture group and control group .
METHODS	Patients of the acupuncture group were treated by acupuncture stimulation of scalp acupoint Dingnie Qianxiexian ( MS @ ) and body acupoints Neiguan ( PC @ ) , Jianyu ( LI @ ) , Sanyinjiao ( SP @ ) , etc. once daily for @ days and routine neurological therapies , including drugs for controlling blood pressure , blood sugar , water-electrolyte balance , anticoagulation , encephaledema reduction , intracranial pressure reduction , anti-inflammation , neurofunction protection , etc. .
METHODS	The stroke patients of the control group were treated with the routine neurological therapies only .
METHODS	The Fugl-Meyer assessment ( FMA ) , US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) were used to assess the patients ' limb function and nerve functional lesion severity before and after the treatment , and the ratio of mortality/disability and recurrence rate were used to assess the efficacy of acupuncture at the end of @ and @ months ' follow-up .
RESULTS	After the treatment , the FMA scores were increased significantly and NIHSS scores decreased considerably in both groups ( P < @ ) , and the effects of acupuncture group were obviously superior to those of the control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between two groups in the ratios of mortality/disability and recurrence rates at the end of @ and @ months ' follow-up ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Scalp acupuncture combined with body acupuncture can evidently improve limb movement function and reduce the nerve function damage in stroke patients .

OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the efficacy of a brief , clinic-based , safer sex program administered by a lay health adviser for young heterosexual African American men newly diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease ( STD ) .
METHODS	Subsequent to STD diagnosis , eligible men ( N = @ ; aged @-@ years ) were randomized to either a personalized , single-session intervention ( delivered by a lay health adviser ) or standard of care .
METHODS	We conducted behavioral assessments at baseline and @ months postintervention ( retention was @ % ) .
METHODS	We also conducted a @-month clinic record review .
RESULTS	Compared to men randomized to the control condition , those receiving the intervention were significantly less likely to acquire subsequent STDs ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) and more likely to report using condoms during last sexual intercourse ( @ % vs @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	They also reported fewer sexual partners ( mean @ vs @ ; P < @ ) and fewer acts of unprotected sex ( mean @ vs @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Based on a @-point rating scale , men in the intervention group had higher proficiency scores for condom application skills ( mean difference = @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A brief clinic-based intervention delivered by a lay health adviser may be an efficacious strategy to reduce incident STDs among young heterosexual African American men .

BACKGROUND	Thrombus aspiration devices have been shown to improve reperfusion criteria and to reduce distal embolization in patients treated by percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI ) in the acute phase of ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .
BACKGROUND	There are , however , little data about their efficacy in the reduction of infarct size .
METHODS	We sought to assess in a prospective randomized trial the impact of thrombus aspiration on infarct size and severity and on left ventricular function in high-risk patients with a first STEMI .
METHODS	The primary end point was scintigraphic infarct size , and secondary end points were infarct severity and regional and global left ventricular function .
METHODS	Forty-four patients with completely occluded ( Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction flow @-@ ) proximal segments of infarct-related artery were randomly assigned to thrombus aspiration group with the Export catheter ( n = @ ) ( Medtronic , Inc , Minneapolis , MN ) or PCI-only group .
METHODS	A rest Tc-@-mibi gated single-photon emission computed tomographic and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were performed @ + / - @ days later .
RESULTS	Infarct size was comparable in patients in the thrombus aspiration group and PCI-only group ( @ % + / - @ % vs @ % + / - @ % of the left ventricle , P = @ ) as was infarct severity in infarct-related artery territory ( @ % + / - @ % vs @ % + / - @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Transmurality score as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging was similar in both groups ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no impact of thrombus aspiration on other secondary end points .
CONCLUSIONS	In our study , thrombus aspiration with the Export catheter performed as adjunctive therapy in high-risk patients with total occlusion of the proximal part of major coronary arteries does not decrease infarct size or severity and has no effect on left ventricular regional and global function .

OBJECTIVE	To test the effectiveness of a complex intervention designed , within a theoretical framework , to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease .
METHODS	Cluster randomised controlled multicentre trial .
METHODS	General practices in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland , regions with different healthcare systems .
METHODS	@ patients with established coronary heart disease registered with one of @ practices .
METHODS	Tailored care plans for practices ( practice based training in prescribing and behaviour change , administrative support , quarterly newsletter ) , and tailored care plans for patients ( motivational interviewing , goal identification , and target setting for lifestyle change ) with reviews every four months at the practices .
METHODS	Control practices provided usual care .
METHODS	The proportion of patients at @ month follow-up above target levels for blood pressure and total cholesterol concentration , and those admitted to hospital , and changes in physical and mental health status ( SF-@ ) .
RESULTS	At baseline the numbers ( proportions ) of patients above the recommended limits were : systolic blood pressure greater than @ mm Hg ( @/@ ; @ % , @ % confidence interval @ % to @ % ) , diastolic blood pressure greater than @ mm Hg ( @/@ ; @ % , @ % to @ % ) , and total cholesterol concentration greater than @ mmol/l ( @/@ ; @ % , @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	At the @ month follow-up there were no significant differences between intervention and control groups in the numbers ( proportions ) of patients above the recommended limits : systolic blood pressure , intervention @/@ ( @ % ) v control , @/@ ( @ % ) , odds ratio @ ( @ % confidence interval @ to @ ; P = @ ) ; diastolic blood pressure , intervention @/@ ( @ % ) v control , @/@ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ to @ ; P = @ ) ; and total cholesterol concentration , intervention @/@ ( @ % ) v control , @/@ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of patients admitted to hospital over the @ month study period significantly decreased in the intervention group compared with the control group : @/@ ( @ % ) v @/@ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Admissions to hospital were significantly reduced after an intensive @ month intervention to improve outcomes for patients with coronary heart disease , but no other clinical benefits were shown , possibly because of a ceiling effect related to improved management of the disease .

BACKGROUND	This trial evaluated the efficacy of amantadine , propranolol and their combination in cocaine dependent patients with severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms .
METHODS	Cocaine withdrawal symptom severity was measured by the cocaine selective severity assessment ( CSSA ) .
METHODS	One hundred and ninety-nine patients with high scores on the CSSA participated in a @-week double-blind trial .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive amantadine ( @ mg/day ) , propranolol ( @mg/day ) , a combination of amantadine ( @ mg/day ) and propranolol ( @mg/day ) or matching placebo capsules .
METHODS	The primary outcome measure was cocaine abstinence .
RESULTS	In the intent-to-treat sample , there were no significant differences between the four medication groups in treatment retention .
RESULTS	The odds of cocaine abstinence showed a marginally significant increase over time in the propranolol group ( p = @ ) but not in the other three groups .
RESULTS	In highly medication-adherent patients , treatment retention was significantly better in the propranolol group compared to the placebo group ( p = @ ) and the odds of cocaine abstinence increased significantly over time in the propranolol group but not in the other three groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In the intent-to-treat sample , none of the three active treatments ( propranolol , amantadine or their combination ) was significantly more effective than placebo in promoting abstinence from cocaine among patients who entered treatment with more severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Among patients highly adherent to study medication , propranolol treatment was associated with better treatment retention and higher rates of cocaine abstinence compared to placebo .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of an elective abdominal surgical operation ( open cholecystectomy ) on the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle in humans .
METHODS	Prospective random control trial .
METHODS	University hospital .
METHODS	@ Metabolically healthy patients who were to undergo elective open cholecystectomy .
METHODS	Patients randomised to receive either saline alone ( n = @ ) or total parenteral nutrition ( n = @ ) for three days after operation .
METHODS	The rate of protein synthesis in muscle was calculated from the increase in enrichment of ( @-@C ) leucine in protein after a flooding dose of ( @-@C ) leucine .
RESULTS	Median ( quartiles ) rate of protein synthesis had decreased on the third postoperative day in the saline group by @ % ( from @ [ @ , @ ] to @ [ @ , @ ] ) and in the group that had received total parenteral nutrition by @ % ( from @ [ @ , @ ] to @ [ @ , @ ] ) ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The trauma associated with open cholecystectomy reduced the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal muscle by half in three days , and conventional total parenteral nutrition had no effect on these changes .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) inhibits hemostasis and platelet function in some individuals ( ASA responders ) but not in others ( ASA nonresponders ) .
METHODS	In this two-part study , part @ was a randomized , double-blind crossover study of the effects of various single doses of ASA ( @ to @ mg ) on primary hemostasis and platelet function .
METHODS	Part @ was a prospective cohort study of the effects of a chronic dose of ASA ( @ mg ) on primary hemostasis and platelet function .
METHODS	A hospital research laboratory and a cardiac care ward .
METHODS	Part @ : @ healthy volunteers ( five male , five female ) .
METHODS	Part @ : @ consecutive patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .
RESULTS	Part @ : ASA , in a dose-related manner , prolonged the bleeding time in @ % of volunteers ( ASA responders ) , which was associated with decreases in platelet thromboxane ( Tx ) A@ and @-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid ( @-HETE ) synthesis and in platelet aggregation and adhesion .
RESULTS	However , in volunteers whose bleeding time was not prolonged ( ASA nonresponders ) , platelet @-HETE synthesis and platelet adhesion were unchanged or increased ( P < @ ) , despite platelet TxA@ and platelet aggregation being inhibited .
RESULTS	Part @ : similarly , @ % of the CABG patients were ASA responders and all of their platelet biochemistry and function tests were inhibited , while in the CABG patient ASA nonresponders ( no prolongation of bleeding time ) , platelet @-HETE and platelet adhesion were increased ( P < @ ) .

OBJECTIVE	The process of inflammation is crucial in migraine , and several nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) are effective in the treatment of migraine attacks .
OBJECTIVE	Despite their efficacy , the routine use of NSAIDs is limited by side effects as well as incomplete efficacy in some patients .
OBJECTIVE	Among the available options , lysine clonixinate ( LC ) and naproxen sodium ( NS ) have proved effective in migraine .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of oral formulations of LC and NS in the treatment of moderate or severe migraine attacks , with a double-blind , crossover design .
METHODS	Seventy subjects ( @ women , @ men ) between ages @ and @ years ( mean age , @ ) with migraine according to the criteria of the International Headache Society were prospectively enrolled .
METHODS	The patients were randomized into @ groups and each participant treated @ migraine attacks .
METHODS	Group @ treated the first attack with LC and the second attack with NS .
METHODS	Group @ treated @ attacks in a counterbalanced order .
METHODS	Doses were @ mg of LC or @ mg of NS , which were encapsulated for equal appearance .
METHODS	Headache intensity , nausea , photophobia , and side effects were evaluated at baseline , @ hour , and @ hours after drug administration .
METHODS	Rescue drugs were allowed after @ hours for those who did n't respond , and this was also compared between groups .
RESULTS	Sixty patients ( @ women , @ men ) completed the study .
RESULTS	At @ hour , @ % patients who used LC were pain-free compared with @ % who used NS ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At @ hours , @ % patients who took LC and @ % who took NS were pain-free ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	At baseline , @ % of the patients randomized to group @ reported nausea , compared with @ % in group @ , and both drugs eliminated nausea : At both @ hour and @ hours , nausea diminished significantly for those taking LC , but only after @ hours for those who took NS ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Both drugs eliminated photophobia at @ hour and @ hours ; however , LC was superior to NS in reducing photophobia at @ hours ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ten patients who took LC and @ who took NS required rescue drugs after @ hours .
RESULTS	Twelve patients who used LC and @ who took NS reported side effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this study did not include a placebo arm , which impairs any definitive efficacy claims , we found LC and NS to be similarly effective and well tolerated in patients presenting moderate or severe attacks of migraine .

BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to elucidate whether the reduction of mortality with amiodarone after myocardial infarction depended on ejection fraction .
METHODS	The data from the Polish Amiodarone Trial were analysed retrospectively .
METHODS	Patients with acute myocardial infarction and contraindications to beta-blockers were randomized on days @-@ after admission to receive amiodarone ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Short and long-term ( @ months ) mortality were analysed comparing the groups with impaired ( ejection fraction < @ % ) and preserved ( ejection fraction > or = @ % ) left ventricular function .
METHODS	A subset of patients ( n = @ ) with available echocardiograms were subjected to this analysis .
RESULTS	Long-term and sudden cardiac mortality were significantly reduced with amiodarone in the group of patients with ejection fraction > or = @ % ( amiodarone versus placebo , respectively : @ versus @ % , P < @ ; @ versus @ , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No beneficial effect of amiodarone was observed in the group with low ejection fraction ( cardiac and sudden cardiac mortality : amiodarone versus placebo , @ versus @ % and @ versus @ % respectively ) .
RESULTS	One-year mortality also revealed a favourable trend only in amiodarone-allocated patients with ejection fraction > or = @ % .
CONCLUSIONS	Amiodarone decreased long-term and sudden cardiac mortality after myocardial infarction only in patients with preserved left ventricular function .
CONCLUSIONS	No benefit was observed in patients with decreased ejection fraction .

BACKGROUND	Evaluation of patient satisfaction with the perioperative care is an integral part of modern quality management .
BACKGROUND	For this purpose simple questioning techniques are often used in clinical practise or reports of clinical trials .
BACKGROUND	However , little research has been performed to investigate whether these tools and methods are useful and provide valid information .
METHODS	Two-hundred patients undergoing elective surgical procedures were interviewed .
METHODS	Five different simple techniques or questions that have been used in the international and in the German literature throughout the last years were applied in random sequence together with the validated German translation of the QoR-@ questionnaire to measure quality of recovery .
METHODS	All analyses were performed descriptively .
RESULTS	All investigated techniques could be answered without help by another person in @ % up to @ % .
RESULTS	All simple dichotomous questions regarding satisfaction were insufficient to discriminate satisfied from less satisfied patients .
RESULTS	A rating using grades known from the German school system ( @ - @ ) and a visual analogue scale ( VAS ; @ - @ mm ) obtained ratings lower than the maximum possible values in @ % and @ % of the patients respectively .
RESULTS	Furthermore , the flexibility that was provided by these tools was not utilized by the patients .
RESULTS	The results of the QoR-@ questionnaire as a marker of postoperative recovery showed only a moderate correlation with ratings of patient satisfaction .
CONCLUSIONS	Until now , there is no method or questioning technique in the German language that can be recommended for a quality assurance program .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , further research is needed to develop tools that provide valid information with adequate resolution to allow discrimination of patient satisfaction with perioperative care .

BACKGROUND	Evidence is weak for the ability of long-term non-invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) to improve survival in patients with stable hypercapnic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) .
BACKGROUND	Previous prospective studies did not target a reduction in hypercapnia when adjusting ventilator settings .
BACKGROUND	This study investigated the effect of long-term NPPV , targeted to markedly reduce hypercapnia , on survival in patients with advanced , stable hypercapnic COPD .
METHODS	This investigator-initiated , prospective , multicentre , randomised , controlled clinical trial enrolled patients with stable GOLD stage IV COPD and a partial carbon dioxide pressure ( PaCO@ ) of @ kPa ( @ mm Hg ) or higher and pH higher than @ .
METHODS	NPPV was targeted to reduce baseline PaCO@ by at least @ % or to achieve PaCO@ values lower than @ kPa ( @ mm Hg ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned ( in a @:@ ratio ) via a computer-generated randomisation sequence with a block size of four , to continue optimised standard treatment ( control group ) or to receive additional NPPV for at least @ months ( intervention group ) .
METHODS	The primary outcome was @-year all-cause mortality .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	The intervention was unblinded , but outcome assessment was blinded to treatment assignment .
METHODS	This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	Patients were recruited from @ respiratory units in Germany and Austria , starting on Oct @ , @ , and terminated with a record of the vital status on July @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to the NPPV group ( n = @ ) or to the control group ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	All patients from the control group and the NPPV group were included in the primary analysis .
RESULTS	@-year mortality was @ % ( @ of @ patients ) in the intervention group and @ % ( @ of @ patients ) in the control group ; hazard ratio @ ( @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ ( @ % ) patients reported facial skin rash , which could be managed by changing the type of the mask .
RESULTS	No other intervention-related adverse events were reported .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of long-term NPPV to standard treatment improves survival of patients with hypercapnic , stable COPD when NPPV is targeted to greatly reduce hypercapnia .

OBJECTIVE	To identify the optimal schedule for infusion of cytarabine ( ara-C ) given with cladribine ( @-CdA ) to pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , and to compare the effects of the two schedules on the pharmacokinetics of ara-C triphosphate ( ara-CTP ) in leukemic cells .
METHODS	Forty-nine pediatric patients with newly diagnosed primary AML received a @-day course of ara-C @ mg/m ( @ ) / d and @-CdA @ mg/m ( @ ) / d.
METHODS	They were randomly assigned to receive ara-C as either a @-hour daily infusion ( arm A ) or a continuous infusion ( arm B ) .
METHODS	Cellular pharmacokinetics were studied on days @ and @ .
METHODS	All patients then received two courses of remission induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin , ara-C , and etoposide ( DAV ) .
RESULTS	Thirty-two percent of patients ( seven of @ ) in arm A and @ % ( @ of @ ) in arm B entered complete remission ( P = @ ) after ara-C and @-CdA therapy .
RESULTS	Coadministration of @-CdA increased the intracellular concentration of ara-CTP in @ of @ patients , although we found no statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in this effect ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of toxicity did not differ significantly between the two treatment arms ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	After two courses of DAV , the rate of complete remission was @ % in arm A and @ % in arm B ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Intracellular accumulation of ara-CTP is increased when @-CdA is given with ara-C , but no schedule-dependent differences in this effect were seen .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of @-CdA and ara-C seems to be effective therapy for pediatric AML .

BACKGROUND	Over the years , the definition of implant failure has varied , with some investigators accounting for all implants placed , while others discard failures that occurred before clinical loading .
BACKGROUND	The influence of stresses transmitted to various bone densities , by different prosthetic appliances as well as the method used to determine failures , needs to be clearly understood .
BACKGROUND	This paper reports on the influence of two different methods of determining @-month survival of implants used to support different dental prostheses .
METHODS	More than @,@ implants with six different designs were placed in @ patients at @ study centers and followed for @ years .
METHODS	The first method of determining survival accounted for all failures from placement through @ months , while the second method counted only failures from post-loading of the prosthesis to @ months .
METHODS	Survival curves were used to determine differences in survival outcomes for the two methods .
RESULTS	For the maxillary single-tooth prosthetic application , implant survival from placement to @ months was @ % when all failures were counted and increased to @ % with the post-loading method .
RESULTS	For upper completely edentulous applications , implant survival was @ % with all failures counted and @ % with the post-loading method .
RESULTS	This @ % difference is clinically important .
RESULTS	The survival for implants in lower completely edentulous applications increased by @ % simply by using the post-loading approach .
RESULTS	Implants used for upper posterior , partially edentulous applications involved only hydroxyapatite ( HA ) - coated implants , and the survival rates were similar ( @ % for all implants and @ % for the post-loading method ) .
RESULTS	The difference in reported survival rates for implants in the lower posterior , partially edentulous application was @ % .
RESULTS	Since failures tended to occur in the earlier phases of treatment , the post-loading approach always resulted in more favorable survival data .
RESULTS	With the post-loading approach , valuable information related to implant performance before loading is lost .
RESULTS	In all comparisons , HA-coated implant survival was always better than non-HA implants .
RESULTS	Clinical investigators should clearly state the method used for determining failures .
RESULTS	For all implants included in the study , survival curves illustrated different failure patterns for each method of determining overall survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Reporting of implant survival rates based on the post-loading method provides more favorable survival rates ; however , accounting for all implants provides a more accurate method of determining survival .

BACKGROUND	The effects of chronic inhibition of @ ' - phosphodiesterase with sildenafil on functional capacity , ventilatory efficiency , oxygen uptake , pulmonary hypertension , and endothelial function in chronic heart failure ( CHF ) are unknown .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial to assess the acute ( @ hour after @ mg by mouth ) and chronic ( @ weeks after @ mg @ times per day by mouth ) effects of sildenafil in outpatients with CHF .
METHODS	The outcomes were cardiopulmonary exercise test parameters ( chronic effect ) , echocardiographic-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure , and plethysmography-derived forearm blood flow ( acute and chronic effects ) .
RESULTS	Nineteen patients with CHF ( @ + / - @ years ) with an ejection fraction of @ % + / - @ % were studied .
RESULTS	Patients who received sildenafil ( n = @ ) showed improved maximal oxygen uptake , ventilatory efficiency , and oxygen uptake kinetics .
RESULTS	Sildenafil decreased pulmonary artery systolic pressure levels at @ minutes and at @ weeks compared with changes after placebo ( P = @ for group and time interaction ) .
RESULTS	Improvement in ventilatory efficiency was positively associated with reductions in pulmonary artery systolic pressure .
RESULTS	Patients allocated to placebo demonstrated a trend toward decreased forearm blood flow after reactive hyperemia , whereas this remained unchanged in patients allocated to sildenafil .
CONCLUSIONS	Sildenafil administration for @ weeks in stable outpatients with CHF improves functional capacity , ventilatory efficiency , oxygen uptake kinetics , and pulmonary hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	These effects may be mediated in part by improvements in endothelial function .

OBJECTIVE	To examine and compare young sex workers ' risk of acquisition of sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) with the risk among their older counterparts .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of young age -- @-@ years vs. @ years and older -- on risk of incident infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae ( GC ) or Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) .
METHODS	A randomized controlled trial of @,@ sex workers in Madagascar was conducted .
METHODS	STI testing was conducted at baseline , @ , @ , and @ months .
RESULTS	About @ % of the cohort ( n = @ ) was composed of young women aged @-@ years .
RESULTS	STI incidence rates in this group over the @-month study period were high : @ / @ woman-years ( WY ) for GC and @ / @ WY for CT compared to @ / @ WY and @ / @ WY for sex workers over age @ , respectively .
RESULTS	In multivariable models , young sex workers were at significantly higher STI risk compared with their older peers : The adjusted risk ratio ( aRR ) for GC comparing younger to older women was @ ( @ % confidence interval ( CI ) : @ , @ ) ; for CT , the aRR was @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) and for GC or CT combined , the aRR was @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This exploratory analysis suggests that additional research is warranted to identify effective and acceptable prevention strategies that benefit young women , and interventions already proven effective among adolescents should be given high priority for scale-up .

OBJECTIVE	To study the influence of acupuncture at Waiguan ( TE@ ) on the functional connectivity of the central nervous system of patients with ischemic stroke .
METHODS	Twenty-four patients with ischemic stroke in the left basal ganglia were randomized based on gender to receive TE@ acupuncture ( n = @ ) or nonacupoint acupuncture ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Each group underwent sham acupuncture and then verum acupuncture while being scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging .
METHODS	Six regions of interest ( ROI ) were defined , including bilateral motor , somatosensory , and bilateral basal ganglia areas .
METHODS	The functional connectivity between these ROIs and all voxels of the brain was analyzed in Analysis of Functional NeuroImages ( AFNI ) to explore the differences between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture at TE@ and between TE@ acupuncture and nonacupoint acupuncture .
METHODS	The participants were blinded to the allocation .
RESULTS	The effect of acupuncture on six seed-associated networks was explored .
RESULTS	The result demonstrated that acupuncture at Waiguan ( TE@ ) can regulate the sensorimotor network of the ipsilesional hemisphere , stimulate the contralesional sensorimotor network , increase cooperation of bilateral sensorimotor networks , and change the synchronization between the cerebellum and cerebrum .
RESULTS	Furthermore , a lot of differences of effect existed between verum acupuncture and sham acupuncture at TE@ , but there was little difference between TE@ acupuncture and nonacupoint acupuncture .
CONCLUSIONS	The modulation of synchronizations between different regions within different brain networks might be the mechanism of acupuncture at Waiguan ( TE@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Stimulation of the contralesional sensorimotor network and increase of cooperation of bilateral hemispheres imply a compensatory effect of the intact hemisphere , whereas changes in synchronization might influence the sensorimotor function of the affected side of the body .

BACKGROUND	Prior reports of decreased levels of essential fatty acids among schizophrenic patients have generated several hypotheses proposing inherent abnormalities in phospholipid and fatty acid metabolism and have provided the basis for treatment trials ; however , these essential fatty acid aberrations may be attributable to uncontrolled factors , such as smoking , rather than abnormalities inherent to schizophrenia .
METHODS	Erythrocyte fatty acid compositions were quantified in @ medicated schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients both at baseline and after @ weeks of supplementation with @ g/day of either ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid or placebo .
METHODS	Current smoking status , gender , dietary survey , and Montgomery Asburg Depression Rating Scale , Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale , and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale scores were assessed .
RESULTS	Schizophrenic patients who smoked had lower baseline erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid percent ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / - @ , p < @ ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) percent ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ , p < @ ) , compared with nonsmokers , with a significant gender interaction ( p < @ ) in multivariate analyses of variance .
RESULTS	Baseline arachidonic acid did not differ .
RESULTS	Smokers reported lower dietary intake ( percent total fat ) of linolenic acid ( F = @ , p < @ ) compared with nonsmokers .
RESULTS	Nonsmoking women reported greater dietary intake of EPA compared with smoking men or nonsmokers of either gender .
CONCLUSIONS	Smoking status , gender , and dietary intake significantly predicted erythrocyte polyunsaturated fatty acid status among schizophrenic patients .
CONCLUSIONS	No evidence was found for subgroups of schizophrenia or relationships to specific symptom severity on the basis of erythrocyte fatty acids .
CONCLUSIONS	Prior reports of abnormalities of essential fatty acid metabolism among schizophrenic patients may have been an artifact of patients ' smoking behavior and differences in dietary intake of omega-@ fatty acids .

BACKGROUND	No pharmacologic therapy has conclusively proved to be effective for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , which is characterized by insulin resistance , steatosis , and necroinflammation with or without centrilobular fibrosis .
BACKGROUND	Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that ameliorates insulin resistance and improves glucose and lipid metabolism in type @ diabetes mellitus .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @ patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type @ diabetes and liver biopsy-confirmed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to @ months of treatment with a hypocaloric diet ( a reduction of @ kcal per day in relation to the calculated daily intake required to maintain body weight ) plus pioglitazone ( @ mg daily ) or a hypocaloric diet plus placebo .
METHODS	Before and after treatment , we assessed hepatic histologic features , hepatic fat content by means of magnetic resonance spectroscopy , and glucose turnover during an oral glucose tolerance test ( [ @C ] glucose given with the oral glucose load and [ @H ] glucose given by intravenous infusion ) .
RESULTS	Diet plus pioglitazone , as compared with diet plus placebo , improved glycemic control and glucose tolerance ( P < @ ) , normalized liver aminotransferase levels as it decreased plasma aspartate aminotransferase levels ( by @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) , decreased alanine aminotransferase levels ( by @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) , decreased hepatic fat content ( by @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) , and increased hepatic insulin sensitivity ( by @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Administration of pioglitazone , as compared with placebo , was associated with improvement in histologic findings with regard to steatosis ( P = @ ) , ballooning necrosis ( P = @ ) , and inflammation ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Subjects in the pioglitazone group had a greater reduction in necroinflammation ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) , but the reduction in fibrosis did not differ significantly from that in the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Fatigue and mild lower-extremity edema developed in one subject who received pioglitazone ; no other adverse events were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	In this proof-of-concept study , the administration of pioglitazone led to metabolic and histologic improvement in subjects with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger controlled trials of longer duration are warranted to assess the long-term clinical benefit of pioglitazone .
CONCLUSIONS	( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT@ [ ClinicalTrials.gov ] . )

BACKGROUND	Gemcitabine and paclitaxel ( Taxol ) each provides an efficacious non-platinum option for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , but the optimal dosage and schedule of the two agents used in combination are not well defined .
METHODS	Previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC were randomized to receive gemcitabine-paclitaxel on a traditional three-weekly schedule ( Arm A ) or a novel weekly schedule ( Arm B ) as follows-Arm A ( three-weekly ) : gemcitabine @ mg/m@ infused > @ min on days @ and @ and paclitaxel @ mg/m@ infused > @ h on day @ of a @-day cycle or Arm B ( weekly ) : gemcitabine @ mg/m@ infused > @ min and paclitaxel @ mg/m@ infused > @ h , both administered on days @ and @ of a @-day cycle .
RESULTS	One hundred patients received at least one dose of treatment .
RESULTS	The weekly schedule , Arm B , was more efficacious and less hematologically toxic than Arm A. Confirmed complete and partial response rates were @ % and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Median survival was @ months on Arm B and @ months on Arm A ( log-rank P = @ ) ; @ - and @-year survival rates also favor Arm B : @ % versus @ % and @ % versus @ % .
RESULTS	Progression-free survival was @ versus @ months , again favoring Arm B ( log-rank P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a two-fold lower frequency of grade @/@ hematologic events with Arm B as follows : neutropenia ( @ % versus @ % ) , thrombocytopenia ( @ % versus @ % ) , and anemia ( @ % versus @ % ) .
RESULTS	One patient ( @ % ) in each treatment group developed febrile neutropenia .
CONCLUSIONS	In this trial , both schedules were efficacious and tolerable , although the weekly schedule resulted in improved survival and lower hematologic toxicity compared with a three-weekly schedule .
CONCLUSIONS	The weekly schedule of gemcitabine-paclitaxel indicates an improved therapeutic index .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effect of understanding their own disease by patients with metastatic breast cancer on their survival potential after being informed by their physician .
METHODS	Two hundred and fourteen women with metastatic breast cancer who participated in a multi-institutional , randomized phase III trial ( Japan Clinical Oncology Group ( JCOG ) Study @ ) were asked whether they understood their own disease after being given information about the clinical trial .
METHODS	They were classified into two groups on the basis of whether they understood or not .
METHODS	We estimated their survival after the time of registration and derived relative hazard ratios from Cox 's proportional hazards model .
RESULTS	There were @ patients in the ` better understanding ' group and @ in the ` poor understanding ' group .
RESULTS	Median survival times after registration were @ and @ months , respectively .
RESULTS	The ` better understanding ' group showed a significant difference from the ` poor understanding ' group ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In multivariate regression analysis , patients who did not understand still showed poorer survival than those who understood ( hazard ratio = @ ; @ % confidence interval ( CI ) @-@ @ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results support the supposition that patients ' understanding of information about their disease may influence their survival .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , it is important to evaluate patients ' recognition about information even after obtaining their consent .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further investigation is needed to clarify the exact nature of this relationship .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to introduce a new prognostic index for patients with brain metastases and compare it with three published indices .
OBJECTIVE	Treatment for brain metastases varies widely .
OBJECTIVE	A sound prognostic index is thus important to guide both clinical decision making and outcomes research .
METHODS	A new index was developed because of limitations in the three existing indices and new data ( Radiation Therapy Oncology Group @ ) are available since the others were developed .
METHODS	All four indices were compared using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group database of @,@ patients with brain metastases from five randomized trials .
METHODS	The ability of the four indices to distinguish its separate classes was determined statistically .
METHODS	Advantages and disadvantages of each index are discussed .
RESULTS	Recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) and the new Graded Prognostic Assessment ( GPA ) had the most statistically significant differences between classes ( p < @ for all classes ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The new index , the GPA , is as prognostic as the RPA and more prognostic than the other indices .
CONCLUSIONS	The GPA is the least subjective , most quantitative and easiest to use of the four indices .
CONCLUSIONS	Future clinical trials should compare the GPA with the RPA to prospectively validate these findings .

METHODS	All ICD candidates received a dual-chamber ICD and were randomized to programmed single - or dual-chamber detection .
METHODS	Of @ patients ( @ male , age @ + / - @ years , left ventricular ejection fraction @ % ) , @ had single-chamber and @ had dual-chamber settings .
METHODS	The detection results were corrected for multiple episodes within a patient with the generalized estimating equations method .
RESULTS	A total of @ spontaneous arrhythmia episodes ( @ patients ) were classified by the investigators ; @ episodes were ventricular tachyarrhythmia ( @ patients ) .
RESULTS	All episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias were appropriately detected in both settings .
RESULTS	In @ patients , @ episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias were recorded .
RESULTS	Detection was inappropriate for @ atrial tachyarrhythmia episodes ( @ % , @ patients ) .
RESULTS	Rejection of atrial tachyarrhythmias was not significantly different between both groups ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Episodes of atrial flutter/tachycardia were significantly more misclassified ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Overall , no significant difference in tachyarrhythmia detection ( atrial and ventricular ) between both settings was demonstrated ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The applied detection criteria in dual-chamber devices do not offer benefits in the rejection of atrial tachyarrhythmias .
CONCLUSIONS	Discrimination of atrial tachyarrhythmias with a stable atrioventricular relationship remains a challenge .

BACKGROUND	Neuroendocrine hormones , which regulate both homeostasis and stress responses , provide homeostatic recovery and sleep suppression to brains under stress .
BACKGROUND	We examined the effects of total sleep deprivation on subsequent enhancement of aversive event memory , implicit fear recognition , and fear conditioning in healthy humans .
METHODS	Three different recognitions ( explicit event , implicit emotion , and physiological response ) were assessed in two groups of @ healthy young volunteers ( sleep control and sleep deprived ) with aversive ( motor vehicle accident films ) and nonaversive episodic memory stimuli .
METHODS	Both groups were tested on Day @ of the experiment and again on Days @ and @ ; the sleep-deprived group was totally deprived of initial nocturnal sleep after the first trial on Day @ .
RESULTS	Event recognition performances were similar in both groups throughout the study .
RESULTS	Implicit fear recognition remained high for aversive stimuli , with generalization of implicit fear recognition occurring for nonaversive stimuli on Day @ in the sleep control group .
RESULTS	Physiological fear and generalized fear responses were observed for every episode , and delayed enhancement of physiological response was only observed for misidentified aversive episodes in the sleep control group on Day @ .
RESULTS	However , in the sleep-deprived group , generalization of implicit fear recognition for nonaversive stimuli on Day @ and all physiological and generalized fear responses on Days @ and @ were comprehensively extinguished .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinically , trauma-exposed victims often experience acute insomnia , indicating that such insomnia might provide prophylactic benefits in reducing the development of posttraumatic stress disorder via extinction of the fear-magnifying effects of memory .

OBJECTIVE	To compare T-tube and pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) as two methods of mechanical ventilation weaning of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) after failed extubation .
METHODS	A prospective randomized trial carried out at the multidisciplinary intensive care unit ( ICU ) over @ years included @ patients with COPD who required mechanical ventilation longer than @ hours .
METHODS	The patients who could be weaned from mechanical ventilation were randomized to either a T-tube or PSV @-hour spontaneous breathing trial .
METHODS	The patients in whom @-hour trial was successful were extubated and excluded from further research .
METHODS	Patients in whom @-hour trial failed had mechanical ventilation reinstated and underwent the same weaning procedure after @ hours in case they fulfilled the weaning criteria .
METHODS	The weaning outcome was assessed according to the following parameters : extubation success , mechanical ventilation duration , time spent in ICU , reintubation rate , and mortality rate .
RESULTS	Two-hour trial failed in @ patients in T-tube and @ patients in PSV group , of whom @ and @ , respectively , were successfully extubated ( P < @ , chi ( @ ) test ) .
RESULTS	Mechanical ventilation lasted significantly longer in T-tube than in PSV group ( @ hours vs @ hours , respectively , P < @ , Mann-Whitney test ) .
RESULTS	Also , patients in T-tube group spent significantly more time in ICU than patients in PVS group ( @ hours [ interquartile range @-@ ] vs @ hours [ @-@ ] , respectively , P < @ , Mann-Whitney test ) .
RESULTS	Reintubation was required in @ and @ patients in T-tube and PVS group , respectively , and death occurred in @ and @ patients , respectively , during ICU stay .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with COPD who failed the @-hour spontaneous breathing trial had more favorable outcome when PVS rather than T-tube method was used for weaning from mechanical ventilation .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy , safety/tolerability , and dose-response relationship of imidafenacin in Japanese patients with overactive bladder .
METHODS	Men and women who had overactive bladder symptoms were randomized equally to double-blind treatment with @ , @ , or @ mg of imidafenacin twice daily or a placebo for @ weeks , and assessed for efficacy and safety .
RESULTS	Overall , @ patients were enrolled and randomized for treatment with @ mg of imidafenacin/day ( @ patients ) , @ mg of imidafenacin/day ( @ ) , @ mg of imidafenacin/day ( @ ) , or a placebo ( @ ) .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of treatment , the number of incontinence episodes was reduced in a dose-dependent manner , and a significant difference between the imidafenacin treatment and the placebo was observed ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the placebo , imidafenacin caused significant reductions in urgency incontinence , voiding frequency , and urinary urgency , and a significant increase in the urine volume voided per micturition .
RESULTS	Imidafenacin was also well tolerated .
RESULTS	The incidence of dry mouth in the imidafenacin groups increased dose-dependently .
RESULTS	Even though the percentage of patients receiving @ mg/day who discontinued treatment due to dry mouth was high ( @ % ) , the percentages in the @ mg/day and @ mg/day groups ( @ % and @ % , respectively ) were comparable with that in the placebo group ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Considering the balance between efficacy and safety , @ mg of imidafenacin twice daily appeared to be a clinically appropriate dose for treating overactive bladder .
CONCLUSIONS	This dose was therefore selected for further evaluation in large-scale phase III studies .

BACKGROUND	Modifiable risk factors , including life-style habits and psychological variables , have been increasingly demonstrated to have an important role in influencing morbidity and mortality in cardiovascular patients , and to account for approximately @ % of the population risk for cardiac events.Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) has shown effectiveness in promoting healthy behaviors , and improving psychological well-being in patients with chronic physical conditions .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , a first application of an acceptance-based program in cardiac patients has revealed high treatment satisfaction and initial evidences of effectiveness in increasing heart-healthy behaviour .
BACKGROUND	However , no clinical trial to date has evaluated the efficacy of an acceptance-based program for the modification of cardiovascular risk factors and the improvement of psychological well-being , compared to usual secondary prevention care .
METHODS	Approximately @ patients will be recruited from an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation unit and randomly assigned to receive usual care or usual care + a brief ACT-based intervention .
METHODS	The ACT group will be administered five group therapy sessions integrating educational topics on heart-healthy behaviours with acceptance and mindfulness skills .
METHODS	Participants will be assessed at baseline , six weeks later ( post treatment for the ACT condition ) , at six and twelve months follow-up .
METHODS	A partially-nested design will be used to balance effects due to clustering of participants into small therapy groups .
METHODS	Primary outcome measures will include biological indicators of cardiovascular risk and self-reported psychological well-being .
METHODS	Treatment effects will be tested via multilevel modeling after which the mediational role of psychological flexibility will be evaluated .
CONCLUSIONS	The ACTonHEART study is the first randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief group-administered , ACT-based program to promote health behavior change and psychological well-being among cardiac patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Results will address the effectiveness of a brief treatment created to simultaneously impact multiple cardiovascular risk factors .
CONCLUSIONS	Conducted in the context of clinical practice , this trial will potentially offer empirical support to alternative interventions to improve quality of life and reduce mortality and morbidity rates among cardiac patients .

BACKGROUND	This study was designed to determine whether physician-led remote telemedical management ( RTM ) compared with usual care would result in reduced mortality in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure ( HF ) .
RESULTS	We enrolled @ stable chronic HF patients in New York Heart Association functional class II or III with a left ventricular ejection fraction @ % and a history of HF decompensation within the previous @ years or with a left ventricular ejection fraction @ % .
RESULTS	Patients were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to RTM or usual care .
RESULTS	Remote telemedical management used portable devices for ECG , blood pressure , and body weight measurements connected to a personal digital assistant that sent automated encrypted transmission via cell phones to the telemedical centers .
RESULTS	The primary end point was death from any cause .
RESULTS	The first secondary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for HF .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were similar between the RTM ( n = @ ) and control ( n = @ ) groups .
RESULTS	Of the patients assigned to RTM , @ ( @ % ) were at least @ % compliant with daily data transfers and no break for > @ days ( except during hospitalizations ) .
RESULTS	The median follow-up was @ months ( minimum @ ) , and was @ % complete .
RESULTS	Compared with usual care , RTM had no significant effect on all-cause mortality ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) or on cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization ( hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In ambulatory patients with chronic HF , RTM compared with usual care was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality .

OBJECTIVE	Our purpose was to test the hypothesis that converting patients with stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications would improve their functional status , symptom control , treatment satisfaction , and quality of life .
RESULTS	A single-blind randomized trial of @ patients with stable coronary artery disease was performed in the outpatient clinic of a Veterans Affairs Health System .
RESULTS	Outpatients with chronic stable angina taking at least @ antianginal medications were studied .
RESULTS	Patients were randomized to one of two treatments : optimal adjustment of their usual antianginal medications or conversion to solely long-acting medications ( long-acting diltiazem + / - nitroglycerin patches + / - atenolol ) with subsequent optimization .
RESULTS	The primary outcome was the @-month change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores .
RESULTS	Although no differences in physical limitation scores were noted , patients randomized to receive long-acting medications had improved symptom control ( @-month improvement in anginal stability [ @ vs @ , P = @ ] and anginal frequency [ @ vs @ , P = @ ] ) , more treatment satisfaction ( @-month improvement of @ vs @ , P = @ ) , and better quality of life ( @-month improvement of @ vs @ , P = @ ) compared with patients whose pretrial medications were optimized .
RESULTS	The improvement in symptom control was statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Converting patients with chronic , stable angina to long-acting antianginal medications resulted in substantial improvements in symptom control with a trend toward better treatment satisfaction and quality of life .

OBJECTIVE	The objectives were to compare the efficacy , occurrence of adverse events , and recovery duration of propofol with and without alfentanil for use in procedural sedation in the emergency department ( ED ) .
METHODS	This was a randomized nonblinded prospective trial of adult patients undergoing procedural sedation for painful procedures in the ED .
METHODS	Patients with pain before the procedure were given intravenous ( IV ) morphine sulfate until their pain was adequately treated at least @ minutes before starting the procedure .
METHODS	Patients received @ mg/kg propofol either with or without a supplemental dose of @ mug/kg alfentanil for deep procedural sedation .
METHODS	Doses , vital signs , nasal end-tidal CO ( @ ) ( ETCO ( @ ) ) , pulse oximetry , and bispectral electroencephalographic ( EEG ) analysis scores were recorded .
METHODS	Subclinical respiratory depression was defined as a change in ETCO ( @ ) of > @ mmHg , an oxygen saturation of < @ % at any time , or an absent ETCO ( @ ) waveform at any time .
METHODS	Clinical events related to respiratory depression were noted during the procedure , including the addition of or increase in the flow rate of supplemental oxygen , the use of a bag-valve mask apparatus , airway repositioning , or stimulation to induce breathing .
METHODS	After the procedure , patients were asked if they experienced pain during the procedure or had recall of the procedure .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were enrolled ; @ underwent sedation and were included in the analysis .
RESULTS	Seventy-four patients received propofol , and @ received propofol with alfentanil .
RESULTS	No clinically significant complications were noted .
RESULTS	Subclinical respiratory depression was seen in @/@ patients in the propofol group and @/@ patients in the propofol/alfentanil group ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Clinical signs of respiratory depression included an increase in supplemental oxygen use in @ of the @ propofol patients and @ of the @ propofol/alfentanil patients ( effect size @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) , the use of bag-valve mask apparatus in seven patients in the propofol group and @ in the propofol/alfentanil group ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) , airway repositioning in @ propofol patients and @ propofol/alfentanil patients ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) , and stimulation to induce breathing in @ propofol patients and @ propofol/alfentanil patients ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	The total time of the procedure was longer for the alfentanil/propofol group ( median = @ minutes , range = @-@ minutes ) than for the propofol group ( median = @ minutes , range = @ to @ minutes ; effect size = @ minutes , @ % CI = @ to @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Pain during the procedure was reported by @ of the @ patients in the propofol group and @ of the @ patients in the propofol/alfentanil group ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Recall of some part of the procedure was reported by @ patients in the propofol group and @ in the propofol/alfentanil group ( effect size = @ % , @ % CI = -@ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	All procedures were successfully completed .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of supplemental alfentanil with propofol for procedural sedation did not result in a difference in reported pain or recall immediately after the procedure .
CONCLUSIONS	There was an increase in the proportion of patients who required stimulation to induce respiration during the procedure in patients who received propofol with supplemental alfentanil .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of supplemental opioid to procedural sedation with propofol does not appear beneficial .

OBJECTIVE	Quality assessment and assurance are important issues in modern health care .
OBJECTIVE	For the evaluation of surgical procedures , there are indirect parameters such as complication , recurrence , and survival rates .
OBJECTIVE	These parameters are of limited value for the individual surgeon , and there is an obvious need for direct parameters .
OBJECTIVE	We have evaluated criteria by which pathologists can judge the quality or completeness of the resection specimen in a randomized trial for rectal cancer .
METHODS	The pathology reports of all patients entered onto a Dutch multicenter randomized trial were reviewed .
METHODS	All participating pathologists had been instructed by workshops and videos in order to obtain standardized pathology work-up .
METHODS	A three-tiered classification was applied to assess completeness of the total mesorectal excision ( TME ) .
METHODS	Prognostic value of this classification was tested using log-rank analysis of Kaplan-Meier survival curves using the data of all patients who did not receive any adjuvant treatment .
RESULTS	Included were @ patients .
RESULTS	In @ % ( n = @ ) , the mesorectum was incomplete .
RESULTS	Patients in this group had an increased risk for local and distant recurrence , @ % v. @ % recurrence in the group with a complete mesorectum ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Follow-up is too short to observe an effect on survival rates .
CONCLUSIONS	A patient 's prognosis is predicted by applying a classification of macroscopic completeness on a rectal resection specimen .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that pathologists are able to judge the quality of TME for rectal cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	With this direct interdisciplinary assessment instrument , we establish a new role of the pathologist in quality control .

BACKGROUND	Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) remains the revascularization treatment of choice for patients with severely symptomatic or life-threatening coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
BACKGROUND	However , @ % to @ % of the patients undergoing CABG will suffer a recurrent ischemic event such as death , recurrent infarction , angina or repeat revascularization .
BACKGROUND	The pathophysiological processes particular to the CABG procedure that may affect graft endothelial function are most active in the early phase after surgery .
BACKGROUND	Angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibition has been shown to be effective in reducing or preventing ischemic events in patients with and without left ventricular dysfunction , and in those at high risk for CAD .
BACKGROUND	Nonetheless , no large clinical trail has investigated this role of ACE inhibition in preventing ischemic events early after CABG .
OBJECTIVE	The Ischemia Management with Accupril post bypass Graft via Inhibition of angiotensin coNverting Enzyme ( IMAGINE ) study addressed whether ACE inhibition initiated early after CABG improves short and long term outcomes in patients after CABG .
METHODS	This multicentre , multinational trial recruited @ patients with an uncomplicated course early after CABG from @ to @ medical care facilities in Canada , The Netherlands , Belgium and France .
METHODS	Eligible patients with normal left ventricular function were randomly assigned to placebo or quinapril ( titrated up to @ mg daily where possible ) within seven to @ days after CABG .
METHODS	All patients were followed up closely for a minimum of @ months after random placement .
METHODS	The median treatment period is expected to be approximately @ months .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of @ mg/day prednisolone on disease progression in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) receiving standardized disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) therapy .
METHODS	Patients with active RA of < @ years ' duration were randomly assigned in a double-blinded manner to receive prednisolone or placebo while starting concomitant DMARD therapy ( gold sodium thiomalate or methotrexate ) .
METHODS	Hand and foot radiographs were taken at baseline and at @ , @ , and @ months and were evaluated according to the Ratingen score and the total modified Sharp/van der Heijde score ( SHS ) .
RESULTS	Of @ included patients , @ were available for the intent-to-treat analysis ( ITT ) .
RESULTS	Seventy-six patients completed the study per protocol ( PP ) .
RESULTS	Radiographic progression ( increase in the Ratingen score ) was significantly less with prednisolone than with placebo .
RESULTS	The difference in the progression rate between the groups was greatest in the first @ months .
RESULTS	At @ months in the ITT population , the least squares ( LS ) mean difference was @ ( @ % confidence interval [ @ % CI ] @ , @ ) , P = @ .
RESULTS	The results were confirmed by the total SHS in the ITT population ( LS mean difference @ [ @ % CI @ , @ ] , P = @ ) and with the PP population .
RESULTS	Clinical and functional outcomes tended to be better and the rate of remissions was higher in the prednisolone group .
RESULTS	Side effects were observed more frequently in the prednisolone group than in the control group : weight gain ( @ versus @ patients ) , hypertension ( @ versus @ patients ) , glaucoma ( @ versus @ patients ) , Cushing 's syndrome ( @ versus @ patients ) , gastric distress ( @ versus @ patients ) , and gastric ulcers ( only with concomitant nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy ; @ versus @ patients ) .
RESULTS	No new lumbar fractures were found in either group .
CONCLUSIONS	The very low daily dose of @ mg prednisolone given over @ years in combination with background DMARD therapy substantially decreased radiographic progression in early RA at low risk .

OBJECTIVE	Treatment options for stroke-related dysphagia are currently limited .
OBJECTIVE	In this study , we investigated whether noninvasive brain stimulation in combination with swallowing maneuvers facilitates swallowing recovery in dysphagic stroke patients during early stroke convalescence .
METHODS	Fourteen patients with subacute unilateral hemispheric infarction were randomized to anodal transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) versus sham stimulation to the sensorimotor cortical representation of swallowing in the unaffected hemisphere over the course of @ consecutive days with concurrent standardized swallowing maneuvers .
METHODS	Severity of dysphagia was measured using a validated swallowing scale , Dysphagia Outcome and Severity scale , before the first and after the last session of tDCS or sham .
METHODS	The effect of tDCS was analyzed in a multivariate linear regression model using changes in Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale as the outcome variable after adjusting for the effects of other potential confounding variables such as the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Dysphagia Outcome and Severity scale scores at baseline , acute ischemic lesion volumes , patient age , and time from stroke onset to stimulation .
RESULTS	Patients who received anodal tDCS gained @ points of improvement in Dysphagia Outcome and Severity scale scores compared to patients in the sham stimulation group who showed an improvement of @ points ( P = @ ) after controlling for the effects of other aforementioned variables .
RESULTS	Six out @ ( @ % ) patients in tDCS stimulation group gained at least @ points of improvement compared with @ out @ ( @ % ) patients in the sham group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Because brain stem swallowing centers have bilateral cortical innervations , measures that enhance cortical input and sensorimotor control of brain stem swallowing may be beneficial for dysphagia recovery .

METHODS	Invasive mean arterial blood pressure , heart rate , peripheral oxygen saturation , the amount of bleeding at surgical site , and blood gas values were recorded .
RESULTS	Controlled hypotension was achieved at a target mean arterial pressure of @ + / -@ mmHg in both groups .
RESULTS	Compared to the baseline levels , heart rate values were lower in the remifentanil group ( p < @ ) , and similar in the sodium nitroprusside group ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	The amount of bleeding and the dryness of the surgical site were similar in two groups .
RESULTS	PaCO@ and pH values differed significantly between the two groups at perioperative @ and @ hours and in the postoperative @th minute ( p < @ ) , but the difference was not clinically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that remifentanil is effective in obtaining controlled hypotension without an additional potent hypotensive agent and provides appropriate surgical conditions by reducing the amount of bleeding .

OBJECTIVE	Among patients with diabetes , major depression is associated with more diabetic complications , lower medication adherence , and poorer self-care of diabetes .
OBJECTIVE	We reported earlier that enhanced depression care reduces depression symptoms but not hemoglobin A@c level .
OBJECTIVE	This study examined effects of depression interventions on self-management among depressed diabetic patients .
METHODS	A total of @ patients in @ primary care clinics were randomized to an evidence-based collaborative depression treatment ( pharmacotherapy , problem-solving treatment , or both in combination ) or usual primary care ( routine medical services ) .
METHODS	Outcome measures included the Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities ( SDSCA ) , reported at baseline and @ , @ , and @ months , and medication non-adherence as assessed by automated pharmacy refill data of oral hypoglycemic agents , lipid-lowering agents , and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors .
METHODS	We used mixed regression models adjusted for baseline differences to compare the intervention with usual care groups at follow-up assessments .
RESULTS	During the @-month intervention period , enhanced depression care and outcomes were not associated with improved diabetes self-care behaviors ( healthy nutrition , physical activity , or smoking cessation ) .
RESULTS	Relative to the usual care group , the intervention group reported a small decrease in body mass index ( mean difference = @ kg/m@ , @ % CI , @ to @ kg/m@ ) and a higher rate of nonadherence to oral hypoglycemic agents ( mean difference = -@ % , @ % CI , -@ % to -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Adherence to lipid-lowering agents and to antihypertensive medicines was similar for the @ groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In general , diabetes self-management did not improve among the enhanced depression treatment group during a @-month period , except for small between-group differences of limited clinical importance .
CONCLUSIONS	Research needs to assess whether self-care interventions tailored for specific conditions , in addition to enhanced depression care , can achieve better diabetes and depression outcomes .

BACKGROUND	Uncertainty regarding the accuracy of the computer as a data collection or patient screening tool persists .
BACKGROUND	Previous research evaluating the validity of computer health surveys have tended to compare those responses to that of paper survey or clinical interview ( as the gold standard ) .
BACKGROUND	This approach is limited as it assumes that the paper version of the self-report survey is valid and an appropriate gold standard .
OBJECTIVE	First , to compare the accuracy of computer and paper methods of assessing self-reported smoking and alcohol use in general practice with biochemical measures as gold standard .
OBJECTIVE	Second , to compare the test re-test reliability of computer administration , paper administration and mixed methods of assessing self-reported smoking status and alcohol use in general practice .
METHODS	A randomised cross-over design was used .
METHODS	Consenting patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups ; Group @ .
METHODS	C-C : completing a computer survey at the time of that consultation ( Time @ ) and a computer survey @-@ days later ( Time @ ) ; Group @ .
METHODS	C-P : completing a computer survey at Time @ and a paper survey at Time @ ; Group @ .
METHODS	P-C : completing a paper survey at Time @ and a computer survey at Time @ ; and Group @ .
METHODS	P-P : completing a paper survey at Time @ and @ .
METHODS	At Time @ all participants also completed biochemical measures to validate self-reported smoking status ( expired air carbon monoxide breath test ) and alcohol consumption ( ethyl alcohol urine assay ) .
RESULTS	Of the @ who were eligible , @ ( @ % ) consented to completing the Time @ surveys .
RESULTS	Of these , @ % ( N = @ ) completed Time @ surveys .
RESULTS	Compared to CO , the computer smoking self-report survey demonstrated @ % sensitivity , @ % specificity , @ % positive predictive value ( PPV ) and @ % negative predictive value ( NPV ) .
RESULTS	The equivalent paper survey demonstrated @ % sensitivity , @ % specificity , @ % PPV , and @ % NPV .
RESULTS	Compared to urine assay , the computer alcohol use self-report survey demonstrated @ % sensitivity , @ % specificity , @ % PPV and @ % NPV .
RESULTS	The equivalent paper survey demonstrated @ % sensitivity , @ % specificity , @ % PPV , and @ % NPV .
RESULTS	Level of agreement of smoking self-reports at Time @ and Time @ revealed kappa coefficients ranging from @ to @ in each group and hazardous alcohol use self-reports at Time @ and Time @ revealed kappa coefficients ranging from @ to @ in each group .
CONCLUSIONS	The collection of self-reported health risk information is equally accurate and reliable using computer interface in the general practice setting as traditional paper survey .
CONCLUSIONS	Computer survey appears highly reliable and accurate for the measurement of smoking status .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to confirm the adequacy of the quantity/frequency measure in detecting those who drink alcohol .
CONCLUSIONS	Interactive computer administered health surveys offer a number of advantages to researchers and clinicians and further research is warranted .

BACKGROUND	Care bundles cluster together several evidence-based practices and , in the intensive care setting , the ventilator care bundle ( VCB ) has been applied widely .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of monthly feedback on VCB compliance .
METHODS	Before and after study : primary outcome measure VCB compliance .
METHODS	Data were collected for @ year from two metropolitan general intensive care units ( ICU ) on one randomly allocated day per week .
METHODS	Baseline data from adult ventilated patients were collected during the first @ months ( phase @ ) .
METHODS	During the second @ months ( phase @ ) , monthly compliance data were provided to each ICU regarding both ICUs ' performance .
RESULTS	Both ` all or nothing ' compliance ( when all four VCB elements were complied with ) and overall compliance ( the average compliance of the four elements ) increased between the two phases .
RESULTS	These increases were mostly small and statistically insignificant .
RESULTS	Although both measures increased in ICU B , both fell in ICU A. ICU B 's overall compliance increase was statistically significant ( p = @ ) , but its ` all or nothing ' compliance increase ( @ % ) , whilst arguably clinically significant , did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	ICU B achieved increased compliance with all four VCB elements in phase @ , whereas ICU A achieved increases in two elements ( deep vein thrombosis and gastric ulcer prophylaxis ) .
RESULTS	Both ICUs achieved @ % compliance with gastric ulcer prophylaxis for all of phase @ .
RESULTS	Head of bed elevation was the least complied with element in phase @ , and increased in ICU B only in phase @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the compliance rates with individual elements are encouraging , the results regarding the effect of feedback on VCB compliance were variable .
CONCLUSIONS	The finding of relatively poor compliance with head of bed elevation is consistent with previous research .
CONCLUSIONS	Further research is needed to determine the effects of audit and feedback , and which strategies are most effective .

BACKGROUND	Creatine supplementation has been shown to augment training-induced strength gains .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of creatine supplementation on recovery of muscle strength after anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction .
OBJECTIVE	Creatine supplementation will facilitate strength gains after ACL reconstruction .
METHODS	Double-blind , prospective , and randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Sixty patients were randomized into creatine or placebo groups .
METHODS	Quadriceps and hamstring strength and power were measured isokinetically .
METHODS	Hip flexor , abductor , and adductor strengths were measured with a handheld dynamometer prior to surgery and at @ weeks , @ weeks , or @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	From @ weeks to @ weeks after surgery , there were significant increases in strength on the involved side for knee extension ( @ % ) , knee flexion ( @ % ) , hip flexion ( @ % ) , hip abduction ( @ % ) , and hip adduction ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	These strength improvements were unaffected by creatine supplementation with similar effects in the creatine and placebo groups .
RESULTS	From @ weeks to @ weeks after surgery , there were significant increases in power on the involved side for knee extension ( @ % ) and knee flexion ( @ % ) , but these effects were not affected by creatine supplementation .
RESULTS	At @ months , creatine supplementation did not affect outcome as measured by the single leg hop test for distance or the knee outcome score .
CONCLUSIONS	The results demonstrate that patients do not benefit from creatine supplementation during the first @ weeks of rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the present study was to compare piezoelectric surgery and conventional rotatory osteotomy for mandibular third molar germ extraction to determine the @ methods ' suitability and the postoperative outcomes .
METHODS	Mandibular third molar germectomy was performed bilaterally , randomly choosing @ side for rotatory osteotomy ( rotatory group ) and the other for piezoelectric surgery ( piezo group ) .
METHODS	The predictor variable was the duration of the surgical procedure .
METHODS	The outcome variables were the suitability of the method used , bleeding , and the postoperative parameters ( ie , mouth opening range , clinical appearance of soft tissues , exudate , abscess , wound dehiscence , locoregional lymphadenopathy , pain on palpation at the extraction site , persistent edema ) at @ and @ days postoperatively .
METHODS	The patients recorded their subjective postoperative pain daily for @ days using a visual analog scale .
METHODS	The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and stepwise logistic regression model with binary variables were used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients ( mean age @ @ years ) were enrolled in the present study .
RESULTS	The time needed to complete the osteotomy and extraction was significantly greater for the piezo group ( @ @ minutes ) than for the rotatory group ( @ @ minutes ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No statistically significant differences emerged between the @ methods for the other outcome variables considered .
CONCLUSIONS	Piezoelectric osteotomy proved comparable to the rotatory method in terms of the surgeon 's perception of the suitability of the @ methods and the related postoperative sequelae .
CONCLUSIONS	However , piezoelectric osteotomy took longer to complete than the rotatory method .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to show the association between changes in clinician self-efficacy and readiness to change and implementation of an asthma management program ( Easy Breathing ) .
METHODS	A @ month randomized , controlled trial was conducted involving @ pediatric practices ( @ clinicians ) .
METHODS	Randomized clinicians received interventions designed to enhance clinician self-efficacy and readiness to change which were measured at baseline and @ years .
METHODS	Interventions consisted of an educational toolbox , seminars , teleconferences , mini-fellowships , opinion leader visits , clinician-specific feedback , and pay for performance .
METHODS	The primary outcome was program utilization ( number of children enrolled in Easy Breathing/year ) ; secondary outcomes included development of a written treatment plan and severity-appropriate therapy .
RESULTS	At baseline , clinicians enrolled @ @ ( mean SD ) children/clinician/year ; @ % of children had a written treatment plan and @ % of plans used severity-appropriate therapy .
RESULTS	At baseline , higher self-efficacy scores were associated with greater program utilization ( relative rate [ RR ] , @ ; @ % confidence interval [ CI ] , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) but not treatment plan development ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) or anti-inflammatory use ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Intervention clinicians participated in @ interventions over @ months .
RESULTS	At study end , self-efficacy scores increased in intervention clinicians compared to control clinicians ( P = @ ) and more clinicians were in an action stage of change ( P = @ ) but these changes were not associated with changes in primary or secondary outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-efficacy scores correlated with program use at baseline and increased in the intervention arm , but these increases were not associated with greater program-related activities .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-efficacy may be necessary but not sufficient for behavior change .

OBJECTIVE	Renal transplant recipients with pre-existing diabetes ( PD ) have reduced graft survival and increased risk of mortality and ischemic heart disease compared with nondiabetic transplant recipients .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of belatacept in this high-risk group , we evaluated outcomes of the subpopulation with PD from previously published BENEFIT and BENEFIT-EXT trials .
METHODS	A post hoc analysis evaluated pooled data from BENEFIT ( living donors or standard criteria donors ) and BENEFIT-EXT ( extended criteria donors ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive cyclosporine or a more intensive ( MI ) or less intensive ( LI ) belatacept regimen .
RESULTS	Of @ intent-to-treat patients , @ had PD .
RESULTS	At @ months , the belatacept LI arm demonstrated a numerically higher rate of patients surviving with a functioning graft ( @ % MI [ @ of @ ] , @ % LI [ @ of @ ] , and @ % cyclosporine [ @ of @ ] ) , and fewer serious adverse events than cyclosporine or MI patients .
RESULTS	Three cases of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder were reported in LI patients , one involving the central nervous system .
RESULTS	Higher rates ( % [ @ % confidence interval ] : @ % MI [ @ to @ ] ; @ % LI [ @ to @ ] ; @ % cyclosporine ( @ to @ ] ) and grades of acute rejection were observed with belatacept .
RESULTS	Measured GFR ( ml/min per @ m ( @ ) , @ MI ; @ LI ; @ cyclosporine ) , and cardiovascular risk profile were better for belatacept versus cyclosporine .
CONCLUSIONS	In post hoc analysis of patients with PD , patient/graft survival and renal function at @ months were numerically higher with belatacept versus cyclosporine , but not statistically significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study is necessary to confirm the benefits belatacept may provide in these patients .

OBJECTIVE	Current therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection is based on the administration of interferon alpha ( IFN ) alone or in combination with other anti-viral agents .
OBJECTIVE	However , such therapy is effective in only a minority of selected patients .
OBJECTIVE	Long-term ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) treatment has been reported to improve liver function and structure especially in cholestatic disorders .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated the effect of long-term UDCA treatment on liver function in respect to the severity of chronic liver disease and HCV genotypes .
METHODS	Forty-five patients with non-cholestatic laparoscopy-biopsy proven HCV-associated chronic hepatitis ( n = @ ) or cirrhosis ( n = @ ) who had not responded to , or were unsuitable for IFN , were randomly assigned to receive UDCA ( @ mg/day ; n = @ ) or no therapy ( n = @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	At entry , all patients were evaluated by means of conventional and quantitative liver function tests ( LFTs ) , including galactose elimination capacity and antipyrine clearance , HCV antibodies , HCV-RNA and HCV genotypes .
METHODS	LFTs were measured at @ and at @ months , whereas HCV-RNA was determined again after treatment .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics were comparable in the two study groups .
RESULTS	Long-term UDCA therapy was well tolerated .
RESULTS	Based on the analysis of variance , there was a significant decrease in serum transaminase , LDH and GGT levels in UDCA treated patients .
RESULTS	By contrast , the activities of these enzymes increased in untreated patients , with AST levels reaching statistical significance only .
RESULTS	Statistical analysis also showed that the improvement in biochemical markers was more pronounced in UDCA treated patients with liver cirrhosis than in those with chronic hepatitis but was similar in patients with HCV genotype @b and non-@b .
RESULTS	However , HCV-RNA was positive in all patients after treatment .
RESULTS	Quantitative LFTs remained , on average , stable over the @ months of the trial in all groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term UDCA treatment is well tolerated in patients with HCV-associated chronic liver disease .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect appears to be greater in cirrhotics than in patients with chronic hepatitis but is independent of HCV genotypes .
CONCLUSIONS	Thus , long-term UDCA treatment , despite the absence of an anti-viral effect , seems beneficial in reducing disease activity in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis who are unsuitable for IFN therapy .

BACKGROUND	In the Women 's Health Initiative Hormone Trials ( WHI-HT ) , breast cancer risk was increased with estrogen plus progestin ( E+P ) but not with unopposed estrogen ( E-alone ) .
BACKGROUND	We hypothesized that E+P would preferentially metabolize to @-hydroxyestrone ( @-OHE@ ) rather than @-hydroxyestrone ( @-OHE@ ) , and that breast cancer risk would be associated with baseline and @ year changes in estrogen metabolites : positively for @-OHE@ levels and negatively for levels of @-OHE-@ and the @:@ ratio .
METHODS	In a prospective case-control study nested in the WHI-HT , @ confirmed breast cancer cases were matched to @,@ controls by age and ethnicity .
METHODS	Using stored serum , @-OHE@ and @-OHE@ levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay at baseline , and for those randomized to active treatment ( n = @,@ ) , at @ year .
RESULTS	The @-year increase in @-OHE@ was greater with E+P than E-alone ( median @ pg/mL vs. @ pg/mL , P < @ ) , but both increased @-OHE@ by @ pg/mL .
RESULTS	Breast cancer risk was modestly associated with higher baseline levels of @-OHE@ and the @:@ ratio , and for estrogen receptor + / progesterone + cases only , higher baseline @-OHE@ levels .
RESULTS	For those randomized to active treatment , breast cancer risk was associated with greater increase in @-OHE-@ and the @:@ ratio , but associations were not significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Although E+P modestly increased @-OHE@ more than E-alone , increase in @-OHE@ was not associated with breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Study results do not explain differences between the WHI E+P and WHI E-alone breast cancer results but metabolism of oral HT , which may explain smaller than expected increase in breast cancer compared with endogenous estrogens .

OBJECTIVE	Intensified insulin therapy using rapid acting insulin analogues is advocated in younger type @ diabetic patients at risk of developing diabetic complications .
OBJECTIVE	Most patients prefer postprandial insulin injections .
OBJECTIVE	So far , however , there were no data on glycemic control by postprandial aspart insulin in patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	To compare blood glucose responsiveness to preprandial vs. postprandial aspart injections , a randomised open intraindividual cross-over trial was carried out .
METHODS	Blood glucose was measured before and one hour after the three main meals and at bedtime .
METHODS	@ insulin-naive patients with type @ diabetes ( age , @ + / - @ years ( mean + / - SEM ) , known duration of the disease , @ + / - @ years ) participated at this study .
RESULTS	Both with preprandial and postprandial injections of aspart insulin , the averages of the @-point blood glucose profiles ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ mmol/l ) were similar .
RESULTS	With postprandial aspart insulin , however , @ % of the blood glucose levels measured one hour after breakfast exceeded > @ mmol/l in comparison to @ % with preprandial aspart insulin ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients injected similar amounts of basal and aspart insulin on both experimental days ( insulin glargin , @ + / - @ U , aspart insulin , @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ U/day , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Both preprandial and postprandial insulin aspart can be allowed to well-controlled type @ diabetic patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , patients will benefit from the recommendation to inject insulin aspart immediately before meal if food with a high glycemic index such as the continental breakfast is to be consumed .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the efficacy of antagonism of rapacuronium - , mivacurium - , rocuronium - and cisatracurium-induced neuromuscular block at the laryngeal adductors ( LA ) .
METHODS	One hundred four patients were randomly assigned to one of eight study groups .
METHODS	They either received rapacuronium @ mg x kg ( -@ ) , mivacurium @ mg x kg ( -@ ) , rocuronium @ mg x kg ( -@ ) or cisatracurium @ mg x kg ( -@ ) .
METHODS	Patients in each treatment group either received edrophonium ( @ mg x kg ( -@ ) ) at @ % recovery of the first twitch ( T@ ) of train-of-four ( TOF ) at the LA or were allowed to recover spontaneously from neuromuscular block .
METHODS	The effect of antagonism on speed of recovery of neuromuscular function at the LA was evaluated .
RESULTS	The time to recovery to a TOF ratio of @ at the LA , when compared to the spontaneous recovery group , was significantly shortened by the administration of edrophonium in patients receiving rapacuronium [ @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ ( mean + / - SD ) min ] , rocuronium ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ min ) and cisatracurium ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ min ) .
RESULTS	Edrophonium administration did not shorten complete recovery from mivacurium-induced block ( @ + / - @ vs @ + / - @ min ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Recovery from rapacuronium - , rocuronium - or cisatracurium - induced neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of @ as measured at the LA was shortened by the administration of edrophonium , when compared to spontaneous recovery .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study in patients with quantitatively determined , poorly developed coronary collaterals was to assess the contribution of ischemic as well as adenosine-induced preconditioning and of collateral recruitment to the development of tolerance against repetitive myocardial ischemia .
BACKGROUND	The development of myocardial tolerance to repeated ischemia is nowadays interpreted to be due to biochemical adaptation ( i.e. , ischemic preconditioning ) .
METHODS	In @ patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , myocardial adaptation to ischemia was measured using intracoronary ( i.c. ) electrocardiographic ( ECG ) ST segment elevation changes obtained from a @-in .
METHODS	( @ cm ) pressure guidewire positioned distal to the stenosis during three subsequent @-min balloon occlusions .
METHODS	Simultaneously , an i.c. pressure-derived collateral flow index ( CFI , no unit ) was determined as the ratio between distal occlusive minus central venous pressure divided by the mean aortic minus central venous pressure .
METHODS	The study patients were divided into two groups according to the pretreatment with i.c. adenosine ( @ mg/min for @ min starting @ min before the first occlusion , n = @ ) or with normal saline ( control group , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Collateral flow index at the first occlusion was not different between the groups ( @ + / - @ in the adenosine group and @ + / - @ in the control group , p = NS ) , and it increased significantly and similarly to @ + / - @ and to @ + / - @ , respectively ( p < @ ) during the third occlusion .
RESULTS	The i.c. ECG ST elevation ( normalized for the QRS amplitude ) was not different between the two groups at the first occlusion ( @ + / - @ in the adenosine group , @ + / - @ in the control group ) .
RESULTS	It decreased significantly during subsequent coronary occlusions to @ + / - @ and to @ + / - @ , respectively .
RESULTS	There was a correlation between the change in CFI ( first to third occlusion ; deltaCFI ) and the respective ST elevation shift ( deltaST ) : deltaST = -@ to @ x deltaCFI ; r = @ , p = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Even in patients with few coronary collaterals , the myocardial adaptation to repetitive ischemia is closely related to collateral recruitment .
CONCLUSIONS	Pharmacologic preconditioning using a treatment with i.c. adenosine before angioplasty does not occur .
CONCLUSIONS	The variable responses of ECG signs of ischemic adaptation to collateral channel opening suggest that ischemic preconditioning is a relevant factor in the development of ischemic tolerance .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the influence of psychological aspects on glycemic control in type @ diabetic patients treated with diet alone or diet plus oral antidiabetic medication using meal-related self-monitoring of blood glucose ( SMBG ) .
OBJECTIVE	These psychological aspects refer to the process of self-management including the tendency to structure situations and activate resources ( self-perception ) , to accept options for action ( self-reflection ) and to believe in self-efficacy ( self-regulation ) .
METHODS	In a randomized controlled @-month group comparison study , one group ( n = @ ; mean age @ years ) used a blood glucose monitoring device , kept a blood glucose/eating diary and received standardized counseling focusing on self-perception , self-reflection and self-regulation .
METHODS	A control group ( n = @ ; mean age @ years ) received non-standardized counseling on diet and lifestyle .
RESULTS	Statistically significant endpoint differences between the SMBG and the control group were seen in glycemic control ( p = @ ) and the well-being item ` depression ' ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	All aspects of counseling were influenced by SMBG with the extent of self-perception and self-reflection gradually increasing over time .
RESULTS	Three HbA@c response types were identified among SMBG patients : continuous-achievers , late-achievers and non-achievers .
CONCLUSIONS	This study identified processes ( structuring the situation and activating resources , accepting options for action and believing in self-efficacy ) which lead to a change in the metabolic profile .
CONCLUSIONS	SMBG coupled with structured counseling provided patients with a tool for taking on more self-control and resulted in an improved outlook on life .
CONCLUSIONS	This short-term intervention involved a structured counseling algorithm which requires @-@ min of physician-patient contact and a structured documentation of metabolic control by the patient and can be taught by a diabetes training team within @ h.
CONCLUSIONS	The identification of the different response types might be of importance in clinical practice as it enables the physician to determine the right counseling option .

BACKGROUND	The authors piloted an HIV testing and counseling ( HTC ) approach using respondent-driven sampling ( RDS ) , financial incentives , and persons living with HIV infection ( PLHIV ) .
METHODS	Eligible participants were aged @-@ years , African American or black , and residents of Oakland , CA .
METHODS	Participants were tested for HIV infection and asked to refer up to @ others .
METHODS	The authors compared the efficiency of RDS to conventional outreach-based HTC with the number needed to screen ( NNS ) .
METHODS	They evaluated the effect of @ randomly allocated recruitment incentives on the enrollment of high-risk or HIV-positive network associates : a flat incentive ( $ @ ) for eligible recruits or a conditional incentive ( $ @-@ ) for eligible recruits in priority groups , such as first-time testers .
RESULTS	Forty-eight participants ( @ PLHIV and @ HIV negative ) initiated recruitment chains resulting in @ network associates .
RESULTS	Nine ( @ % ) participants tested HIV positive , of whom @ ( @ % ) were previously recognized .
RESULTS	RDS was more efficient than conventional HTC at identifying any PLHIV ( new or previously recognized ; RDS : NNS = @ , @ % CI : @ to @ ; conventional : NNS = @ , @ % CI : @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the @ incentive groups in the likelihood of recruiting at least @ high-risk HIV-negative or HIV-positive network associate ( adjusted odds ratio = @ , @ % CI : @ to @ ) or in total number of high-risk HIV-negative or HIV-positive associates ( adjusted odds ratio = @ , @ % CI : @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Social network HTC strategies may increase demand for HTC and efficiently identify PLHIV .
CONCLUSIONS	The flat incentive was as successful as the conditional incentive for recruiting high-risk individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	Unexpectedly , this method also reidentified PLHIV aware of their status .

BACKGROUND	Arsenic ( As ) occurs as monomethylarsonic acid ( MMA ) and dimethylarsinic acid ( DMA ) in humans , and the methylation pattern demonstrates large interindividual differences .
BACKGROUND	The fraction of urinary MMA is a marker for susceptibility to As-related diseases .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the impact of polymorphisms in five methyltransferase genes on As metabolism in two populations , one in South America and one in Southeast Asia .
OBJECTIVE	The methyltransferase genes were arsenic ( + III oxidation state ) methyltransferase ( AS@MT ) , DNA-methyltransferase @a and @b ( DNMT@a and DNMT@b , respectively ) , phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ( PEMT ) , and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( BHMT ) .
OBJECTIVE	AS@MT expression was analyzed in peripheral blood .
METHODS	Subjects were women exposed to As in drinking water in the Argentinean Andes [ n = @ ; median total urinary As ( U-As ) , @ g/L ] and in rural Bangladesh ( n = @ ; U-As , @ g/L ; all in early pregnancy ) .
METHODS	Urinary As metabolites were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry .
METHODS	Polymorphisms ( n = @ ) were genotyped with Sequenom , and AS@MT expression was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction using TaqMan expression assays .
RESULTS	Six AS@MT polymorphisms were significantly associated with As metabolite patterns in both populations ( p @ ) .
RESULTS	The most frequent AS@MT haplotype in Bangladesh was associated with a higher percentage of MMA ( % MMA ) , and the most frequent haplotype in Argentina was associated with a lower % MMA and a higher percentage of DMA .
RESULTS	Four polymorphisms in the DNMT genes were associated with metabolite patterns in Bangladesh .
RESULTS	Noncoding AS@MT polymorphisms affected gene expression of AS@MT in peripheral blood , demonstrating that one functional impact of AS@MT polymorphisms may be altered levels of gene expression .
CONCLUSIONS	Polymorphisms in AS@MT significantly predicted As metabolism across these two very different populations , suggesting that AS@MT may have an impact on As metabolite patterns in populations worldwide .

OBJECTIVE	To study the effects on myocardial ischaemia of @ mg of atenolol , @ mg of slow release nifedipine , and their fixed combination given @ hourly .
METHODS	A treadmill exercise test and @ hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were carried out after a period of five days off treatment ( control ) and at the end of three weeks of each treatment period .
METHODS	@ patients with stable angina pectoris , documented coronary artery disease , and a positive exercise test were randomised in a double blind , three way , cross over study .
RESULTS	Compared with the control , nifedipine significantly induced an increase in resting heart rate of ( mean ( SEM ) ) @ ( @ ) beats/min whereas atenolol and the combination significantly reduced it by @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) beats/min respectively .
RESULTS	The number of exercise tests rendered negative after each intervention was five for nifedipine , nine for atenolol , and @ for the combination .
RESULTS	Compared with the control the time to the start of myocardial ischaemia ( @ mm ST segment depression ) during exercise significantly increased by @ ( @ ) min after nifedipine , by @ ( @ ) min after atenolol , and by @ ( @ ) min after the combination ; rate-pressure product ( beats/min .
RESULTS	mm Hg ) at @ mm ST segment depression increased by @ ( @ ) after nifedipine but fell by @ ( @ ) and @ ( @ ) after atenolol and the combination .
RESULTS	The weekly frequency of angina was reduced from a mean of five while taking nifedipine , to three while taking atenolol , and to two while taking the combination .
RESULTS	The total ischaemic time during ambulatory monitoring was significantly reduced from @ ( @ ) min during control to @ ( @ ) min during nifedipine , to @ ( @ ) min during atenolol , and to @ ( @ ) min during the combination .
CONCLUSIONS	The undesirable effect of a high basal heart rate induced by nifedipine was neutralised by its combination with atenolol .
CONCLUSIONS	Whereas atenolol and the combination were equally efficacious in controlling exercise induced ischaemia , the combination was more effective in reducing total ischaemic burden .

BACKGROUND	Although preclinical and epidemiological data suggest that statins may have antineoplastic properties , the impact of statin use on patient survival after a curative resection of stage III colon cancer is unknown .
METHODS	We conducted a prospective observational study of @ patients with stage III colon cancer enrolled in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial from April @ to May @ to investigate the relationship between statin use and survival .
METHODS	Disease-free survival ( DFS ) , recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) , and overall survival ( OS ) were investigated by Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests in the overall study population and in a subset of patients stratified by KRAS mutation status ( n = @ ) , and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the simultaneous impact of confounding variables .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	Among @ patients , @ ( @ % ) reported statin use after completing adjuvant chemotherapy .
RESULTS	DFS among statin users and nonusers was similar ( hazard ratio [ HR ] of cancer recurrence or death = @ , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	RFS and OS were also similar between statin users and nonusers ( adjusted HR of cancer recurrence = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ; adjusted HR of death = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	Survival outcomes were similar regardless of increasing duration of statin use before cancer diagnosis ( P ( trend ) = @ , @ , and @ for DFS , RFS , and OS , respectively ) .
RESULTS	The impact of statin use did not differ by tumor KRAS mutation status , with similar DFS , RFS , and OS for statin use among mutant and wild-type subgroups ( P ( interaction ) = @ , @ , and @ for DFS , RFS , and OS , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Statin use during and after adjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with improved DFS , RFS , or OS in patients with stage III colon cancer , regardless of KRAS mutation status .

BACKGROUND	Topical nitroglycerin ( GTN ) is one of the medical treatments of choice in chronic anal fissure .
BACKGROUND	The present prospective , randomized , clinical trial was conducted to study the symptomatic relief , healing , and changes in the maximum anal resting pressure ( MARP ) in patients with chronic anal fissure comparing topical GTN and lateral sphincterotomy .
METHODS	Forty consecutive patients with chronic anal fissure were randomized for treatment with either topical GTN or internal sphincterotomy ( @ patients in each group ) .
METHODS	Anal manometry was done before treatment in all patients , and @ h after application of GTN or sphincterotomy .
METHODS	Patients were followed at @-weekly intervals for @ weeks for symptomatic relief and healing .
RESULTS	Both GTN and sphincterotomy brought about a highly significant , but comparable drop in the MARP after treatment ( P < @ in both groups ) .
RESULTS	Sphincterotomy relieved pain much earlier compared to GTN ( @ % vs @ % at @ weeks , P = @ ) ; but after @ weeks of treatment , pain relief in both groups was comparable .
RESULTS	Healing in the sphincterotomy group was also earlier than with GTN ( @ % vs @ % at @ weeks , P < @ ; and @ % vs @ % at @ weeks , P < @ ) ; but after @ weeks , healing in both groups was comparable .
RESULTS	Sphincterotomy had a significant incidence of minor , short-term complications ; it also required surgical expertise , theatre time , and day-care beds .
RESULTS	Nitroglycerin is safe , with mild and tolerable side-effects of headache and local burning sensation .
CONCLUSIONS	Topical GTN should be the initial treatment in chronic anal fissure .
CONCLUSIONS	Lateral sphincterotomy should be reserved for patients with severe disabling pain ( because pain relief is much faster ) , and for patients not responding to at least @ weeks of GTN therapy .

BACKGROUND	Bevacizumab , the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent , provides clinical benefit when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small-cell lung cancer .
BACKGROUND	We report the final overall survival ( OS ) analysis from the phase III AVAiL trial .
METHODS	Patients ( n = @ ) received cisplatin @ mg/m ( @ ) and gemcitabine @ mg/m ( @ ) for up to six cycles plus bevacizumab @ mg/kg ( n = @ ) , bevacizumab @ mg/kg ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) every @ weeks until progression .
METHODS	Primary end point was progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; OS was a secondary end point .
RESULTS	Significant PFS prolongation with bevacizumab compared with placebo was maintained with longer follow-up { hazard ratio ( HR ) [ @ % confidence interval ( CI ) ] @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ and @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ } for the @ and @ mg/kg groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Median OS was > @ months in all treatment groups ; nevertheless , OS was not significantly increased with bevacizumab [ HR ( @ % CI ) @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ and @ ( @-@ @ ) , P = @ ] for the @ and @ mg/kg groups , respectively , versus placebo .
RESULTS	Most patients ( approximately @ % ) received multiple lines of poststudy treatment .
RESULTS	Updated safety results are consistent with those previously reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Final analysis of AVAiL confirms the efficacy of bevacizumab when combined with cisplatin-gemcitabine .
CONCLUSIONS	The PFS benefit did not translate into a significant OS benefit , possibly due to high use of efficacious second-line therapies .

OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that topiramate is more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms in patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia when combined with ongoing antipsychotic medication .
METHODS	Twenty-six hospitalized treatment-resistant patients with chronic DSM-IV-diagnosed schizophrenia participated in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in which @ mg/day of topiramate was gradually added to their ongoing treatment ( clozapine , olanzapine , risperidone , or quetiapine ) over two @-week crossover treatment periods .
METHODS	Data were collected from April @ to November @ .
RESULTS	In intention-to-treat analysis , topiramate was more effective than placebo in reducing Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale general psychopathologic symptoms ( effect size = @ , p = @ ) , whereas no significant improvement was observed in positive or negative symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	Glutamate antagonist topiramate may be an effective adjuvant treatment in reducing general psychopathologic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia resistant to treatment with second-generation antipsychotics .

###17549330
OBJECTIVE	To compare standardized and functional aphasia tests in patients after acute stroke .
METHODS	Data were collected at baseline and at @ months in @ prospective single-centre studies : one observational study ( study I , n = @ ) and one randomized trial of moclobemide vs placebo ( study II , n = @ ) .
METHODS	Patients with aphasia after acute stroke .
METHODS	Degree of aphasia was examined using the Coefficient ( Coeff ) in Norsk Grunntest for Afasi ( standardized ) and the Amsterdam-Nijmegen Everyday Language Test ( ANELT ) ( functional ) .
METHODS	Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance and multivariate regression analyses .
RESULTS	The degree of aphasia measured with Coeff and ANELT correlated closely throughout the study ( r@ = @-@ @ , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	In study I , @ patients recovered completely within @ months .
RESULTS	A Coeff > or = @ and ANELT > or = @ predicted complete recovery equally well .
RESULTS	Coeff was sensitive to differentiate between patients with low values on ANELT , whereas ANELT was sensitive to differentiate between patients with high Coeff values .
CONCLUSIONS	The @ tests show a close and consistent correlation over time and are equally sensitive to improvement .
CONCLUSIONS	They have a similar capacity to predict complete recovery .
CONCLUSIONS	A standardized test appears to be more suitable for patients with aphasia in the acute stage , while a functional test is more suitable in the subacute/chronic stage .

###21504256
OBJECTIVE	To test whether an interactive voice response ( IVR ) system phone call was equally effective as a nurse-delivered phone call at educating and preparing patients for flexible sigmoidoscopy ( FS ) and colonoscopy examinations .
METHODS	Three-arm randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	The trial included patients with upcoming FS or colonoscopy appointments to test the equivalence of an IVR system to nurse-delivered phone calls in reducing appointment nonattendance and inadequate preparation for an examination .
METHODS	Message timing and satisfaction with the intervention were assessed .
METHODS	The @ study conditions included the following : nurse phone call @ days before the procedure , IVR system call @ days before the procedure , and IVR system call @ days before the procedure .
METHODS	All calls included an appointment reminder , information about preparation for the examination , and encouragement to prepare for and attend the examination .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were eligible for the study ; of these , @ ( @ % ) were scheduled for FS and @ ( @ % ) for colonoscopy .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences across the @ study arms in appointment attendance or adherence to preparation instructions .
RESULTS	Significantly more patients in IVR conditions reported neutral perceptions about the phone calls , and more patients receiving nurse calls reported very positive perceptions about the phone calls .
CONCLUSIONS	An IVR system call is as effective as a nurse phone call for ensuring that patients attend appointments and are adequately prepared for endoscopy examinations .

BACKGROUND	Hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) involves substantial morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	Current management strategies have major limitations , and there has been little progress in the development of newer therapies .
BACKGROUND	Arginine vasopressin-receptor antagonists may have promise in the treatment of ADHF in view of their ability to facilitate diuresis .
BACKGROUND	This pilot study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous conivaptan , a dual arginine vasopressin V ( @A ) / V ( @ ) - receptor antagonist , in treating ADHF .
RESULTS	In a double-blind , multicenter trial , @ patients hospitalized for worsening heart failure and given standard therapy were randomly assigned to treatment with conivaptan ( @-mg loading dose followed by @ successive @-hour continuous infusions of @ , @ , or @ mg/d ) or placebo .
RESULTS	The conivaptan and placebo groups did not differ significantly in patient or clinician assessments of global and respiratory status at @ hours .
RESULTS	There was no evidence of worsening heart failure in any group .
RESULTS	Conivaptan at each dosage increased urine output significantly more than placebo at @ hours ( P < or = @ ) , with the difference averaging @ to @ L. Decreases in mean body weight with conivaptan @ and @ mg/d ( approximately @-@ kg ) paralleled the increases in urine output but did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	Conivaptan was well tolerated and not associated with clinically important changes in vital signs , electrolyte disturbances , or cardiac rhythm .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events were infusion-site reactions .
CONCLUSIONS	When added to standard therapy for ADHF , conivaptan safely improves urine output .
CONCLUSIONS	Further study of this compound in ADHF may be warranted , especially in view of the limitations of current treatment for this syndrome .

###16082528
OBJECTIVE	We explored the impact of baseline left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) and losartan treatment on renal and cardiovascular ( CV ) events in @,@ patients from the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan ( RENAAL ) trial , which studied the effects of losartan on the progression of renal disease and/or death in patients with type @ diabetes and nephropathy .
METHODS	LVH was assessed using ECG criteria ( Cornell product and/or Sokolow-Lyon voltage ) .
METHODS	The risk of renal or CV events was determined by a proportional hazards model fit with treatment allocation and presence of LVH .
METHODS	Covariates at baseline included age , sex , systolic BP , mean arterial pressure , pulse , proteinuria , serum creatinine , albumin and haemoglobin .
RESULTS	A total of @ subjects ( @ % ) had LVH at baseline .
RESULTS	Treatment with losartan resulted in a significant decrease in the Cornell product ( -@ % ) and Sokolow-Lyon voltage ( -@ % ) .
RESULTS	LVH was shown to be significantly associated with the primary endpoint , which was a composite of doubling of serum creatinine ( DSCR ) , endstage renal disease ( ESRD ) or death ( hazard ratio [ HR ] = @ , p = @ ) , as well as with the composite renal endpoint of DSCR/ESRD ( HR = @ , p = @ ) and CV events ( HR = @ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Losartan treatment of patients with LVH decreased the CV as well as renal risk to a level similar to that of patients without LVH .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with type @ diabetes and nephropathy , LVH is associated with significantly increased risk of CV events and the progression of kidney disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Importantly , in patients with LVH , losartan reduced the CV as well as the renal risk to a level similar to that seen in subjects without LVH .

BACKGROUND	The evaluation of cardiac contraction could benefit from a connection with the underlying helical structure of cardiac fibers in athletes either completely healthy or with minor common cardiopathies like Bicuspid Aortic Valve ( BAV ) .
BACKGROUND	This study aims to exploit the potential role of @D strain to improve the physiological understanding of LV function and modification due to physical activity as a comparative model .
METHODS	Three age-matched groups of young ( age @ ) individuals are prospectively enrolled : @ normal healthy subjects , @ healthy athletes , and @ athletes with bicuspid aortic valve ( BAV ) .
METHODS	All subjects underwent echocardiographic examination and both @D and @D strain analysis .
RESULTS	All echo parameters were within the normal range in the three groups .
RESULTS	Global values of end-systolic longitudinal and circumferential strain , assesses by either @D or @D analysis , were not significantly different .
RESULTS	The @D strain analysis was extended in terms of principal and secondary strain ( PS , SS ) .
RESULTS	Global PS was very similar , global SS was significantly higher in athletes and displays a modified time course .
RESULTS	The comparative analysis of strain-lines pattern suggests that the enhancement of LV function is achieved by a more synchronous recruitment of both left - and right-handed helical fibers .
CONCLUSIONS	@D strain analysis allows a deeper physiological understanding of LV contraction in different types of athletes .
CONCLUSIONS	Secondary strain , only available in @D , identifies increase of performances due to physical activity ; this appears to follow from the synergic activation of endocardial and epicardial fibers .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether using live actors to increase the reality of the scenario improves knowledge retention in Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) Courses .
OBJECTIVE	MAIN SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : To determine the effects of age , time since graduation from nursing or medicine , sex , medical specialty , and workplace in knowledge retention .
METHODS	From December @ to October @ , @ selected ACLS courses were divided at random in two groups : group A ( ACLS courses with conventional manikins plus live actors ) and group B ( ACLS courses with conventional manikins ) .
METHODS	The live actors vocalized appropriately to create more realistic scenarios .
METHODS	The participants ' relevant theoretical knowledge was assessed before the course ( pre-test ) , immediately after the course ( post-test ) , and @ months after the course ( final-test ) .
RESULTS	Four hundred and thirty-five participants were recruited and allocated at random allocated to either group A or B. Overall , the data of @ participants ( @ % ; @ in group A and @ in group B ) who completed the entire sequence of pre - , post - , and final-tests were analysed .
RESULTS	On univariate analysis , the use of live actors , workplace , gender , and healthcare provider profession did not affect pre - , post - , and final-test results ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	The results in all three tests correlated negatively with time since medical or nursing graduation ( @ % C.I. -@ to -@ , -@ to -@ , and -@ to -@ , respectively , p < @ ) and age ( and @ % C.I. -@ to -@ , -@ to -@ , and -@ to -@ , respectively , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of live actors did not affect knowledge retention in this group .
CONCLUSIONS	Older age and a longer period since graduation were associated with the worst scores and the lowest levels of knowledge retention .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the efficacy of alprazolam in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial of alprazolam during eight menstrual cycles .
METHODS	Outpatient clinic at the National Institute of Mental Health , Bethesda , Md. .
METHODS	Twenty-two women with prospectively confirmed premenstrual syndrome entered this study .
METHODS	All subjects were either self-referred or were referred by their physicians .
METHODS	All reported having regular menstrual cycle lengths , were taking no medication , and were free of current or recent medical or psychiatric illness .
METHODS	Two subjects did not complete the trial .
METHODS	Participants were assigned to receive alprazolam or placebo as follows : cycle @ , @ mg of alprazolam or placebo three times daily beginning on menstrual cycle day @ ; cycle @ , @ mg of alprazolam or placebo three times daily according to the regimen during the first cycle ; cycles @ and @ , @ mg of alprazolam or placebo three times daily from menstrual cycle day @ and continued throughout the fourth menstrual cycle to evaluate the efficacy of relatively long-term ( approximately @ weeks ) treatment with alprazolam .
METHODS	Daily self-report symptoms ratings were completed during the entire study period .
RESULTS	We observed no significant differences in the severity of premenstrual symptom ratings during alprazolam administration compared with placebo on any scale except the Beck Depression Inventory Scale .
RESULTS	The Beck Depression Inventory ratings demonstrated a statistically ( F@ ,@ = @ , P < @ ) , but not clinically , significant improvement in depressive symptoms during alprazolam administration compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings do not support alprazolam as a uniformly effective treatment for the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome .

BACKGROUND	The usefulness of unipolar electrograms ( EGMs ) has been reported in assessing lesion transmurality and conduction block along ablation lines .
BACKGROUND	It is unknown whether unipolar and bipolar EGM characteristics predict exit block during pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) procedures .
RESULTS	Twenty patients ( @ @ years ; @ males [ @ % ] ) undergoing PVI with a circular mapping catheter ( CMC ) placed outside each PV ostium were retrospectively studied .
RESULTS	After entrance block was achieved , pacing at each bipole around the CMC was performed to assess for absence of atrial capture ( exit block ) .
RESULTS	Bipolar EGMs recorded before pacing were examined for voltage , duration , fractionation , and monophasic morphology .
RESULTS	Unipolar EGMs were examined for positive and negative amplitude , PQ segment elevation , fractionation , and monophasic morphology .
RESULTS	The association of these parameters with atrial capture ( absence of exit block ) at each site was analyzed .
RESULTS	After achievement of entrance block , only @ of @ PV antra ( @ % ) exhibited exit block .
RESULTS	Unipolar EGMs at sites with persistent capture were more likely to be fractionated and had larger negative deflections .
RESULTS	Bipolar EGMs at sites with persistent capture showed higher amplitude , longer duration , were more likely to be fractionated , and were less likely to be monophasic .
RESULTS	In a multivariate logistic regression model , bipolar and unipolar fractionation , bipolar duration , and lack of bipolar monophasic morphology were independently associated with persistent atrial capture .
CONCLUSIONS	Specific unipolar and bipolar EGM characteristics are associated with left atrium capture after PV antral isolation .
CONCLUSIONS	These parameters might be useful in predicting the need for further ablation to achieve exit block .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether treatment with prolonged low-dose adjuvant chemotherapy could improve survival of patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer .
METHODS	Four hundred fifty-two patients with axillary node-positive breast cancer who received postoperative irradiation were prospectively randomized in a trial ( European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [ EORTC ] @ ) that compared surgery followed by prolonged low-dose chemotherapy versus surgery alone .
METHODS	Chemotherapy was given for a period of @ years and consisted of monthly courses of cyclophosphamide @ mg/m@ orally on days @ to @ , methotrexate @ mg/m@ intravenously on days @ and @ , and fluorouracil @ mg/m@ intravenously on days @ and @ ( CMF ) .
RESULTS	At a median follow-up time of @ years , the overall survival duration was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm ( hazards ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ten-year overall survival rates ( + / - SE ) were @ % ( + / - @ % ) for the chemotherapy arm and @ % ( + / - @ % ) for the control arm .
RESULTS	Time to local relapse was significantly prolonged in the chemotherapy arm ( hazards ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients with one to three positive axillary nodes and patients with estrogen receptor-negative tumors especially benefited from chemotherapy .
RESULTS	Toxicity was observed in @ % of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that prolonged low-dose adjuvant CMF can significantly prolong overall survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	However , considering the fact that toxicity was still considerable despite reducing the dose of chemotherapy by @ % , we believe that conventionally dosed short-term regimens are preferable in the treatment of node-positive breast cancer .

OBJECTIVE	Insulin detemir is a soluble basal insulin analog with a unique mechanism of protracted action designed to reduce the variability associated with conventional basal insulins .
OBJECTIVE	This trial compared the glycemic control , risk of hypoglycemia , and effect on body weight of insulin detemir and NPH insulin in patients with type @ diabetes treated with rapid-acting insulin aspart at meals .
METHODS	This study was a @-month multinational open parallel-group comparison conducted at @ centers in five countries and included @ patients with type @ diabetes randomized @:@ to insulin detemir or NPH insulin , respectively .
RESULTS	After @ months , comparable HbA ( @c ) levels were found between the two treatment groups .
RESULTS	Fasting plasma glucose tended to be lower in patients treated with insulin detemir , but this difference was not statistically significant ( -@ mmol/l , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Within-subject variation in self-measured fasting blood glucose was lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin ( SD @ vs. @ mmol/l , P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Risk of hypoglycemia was @ % lower with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin ( P < @ ) and @ % lower for nocturnal ( @-@ ) hypoglycemia ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Nightly plasma glucose profiles were smoother and more stable with insulin detemir ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Body weight was significantly lower with insulin detemir at the end of the trial ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with insulin detemir resulted in more predictable glycemic control , with smoother plasma glucose profiles than NPH insulin and a significant reduction in the risk of hypoglycemia .
CONCLUSIONS	The reduction in body weight with insulin detemir is a potential additional advantage .
CONCLUSIONS	Regimens optimized for insulin detemir may be able to improve glycemic control beyond that possible with NPH insulin .

BACKGROUND	Laparoscopic surgery performed with a patient in the Trendelenburg position is known to have adverse effects on pulmonary gas exchange and respiratory mechanics .
BACKGROUND	We supposed that prolonged inspiratory time can improve gas exchange at lower airway pressure .
METHODS	One hundred patients undergoing gynaecologic laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned to one of four groups : conventional inspiratory-to-expiratory ( I : E ) ratio ( Group @ : @ ) , I : E ratio of @ : @ ( Group @ : @ ) , @ : @ ( Group @ : @ ) , or @ : @ with external positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) of @ cmH@ O ( Group @ : @ PEEP ) .
METHODS	Tidal volume was set to @ ml/kg , and I : E ratio was adjusted at the onset of pneumoperitoneum .
METHODS	Arterial blood gas analysis with measurements of partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen ( PaO@ / FiO@ ) , and physiologic dead space-to-tidal volume ratio ( VD / VT ) was performed @ min after anaesthetic induction ( T@ ) , and @ ( T@ ) and @ min ( T@ ) after onset of CO@ insufflation .
RESULTS	PaO@ / FiO@ at T@ in Groups @ : @ , @ : @ , and @ : @ PEEP were higher than Group @ : @ .
RESULTS	The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide at T@ in Group @ : @ was lower than the other groups .
RESULTS	The VD / VT at T@ and T@ were lower in Groups @ : @ and @ : @ than Groups @ : @ and @ : @ PEEP .
RESULTS	Peak or plateau airway pressure was higher in Group @ : @ PEEP than the other groups .
CONCLUSIONS	A prolonged inspiratory time demonstrated a beneficial effect on oxygenation .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , it showed better CO@ elimination without elevating the peak or plateau airway pressure compared with applying external PEEP .
CONCLUSIONS	In terms of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics , a prolonged inspiratory time appears to be superior to applying external PEEP in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position .

OBJECTIVE	The relationship between high blood pressure and the incidence of stroke is well established .
OBJECTIVE	Currently the effects of lowering blood pressure in patients with established cerebrovascular disease is undetermined , and there is continuing concern regarding the treatment of patients soon after a stroke event .
OBJECTIVE	Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors maintain cerebral blood flow despite lowering blood pressure in patients with heart failure and otherwise uncomplicated hypertension .
OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that perindopril , an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with a gradual onset of action and a minimal first-dose hypotensive effect , lowers blood pressure without adversely affecting cerebral blood flow in patients @ to @ days after symptoms of cerebral infarction .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive @ days of oral perindopril ( @ mg ) or placebo in a double-blind study .
METHODS	Blood pressure was monitored semiautomatically .
METHODS	Cerebral blood flow was calculated from internal carotid artery and vertebral Doppler ultrasound , supplemented by middle cerebral artery blood velocities .
RESULTS	Twenty-four patients completed the protocol ; four additional patients were withdrawn for reasons unrelated to treatment .
RESULTS	Patients on perindopril had a placebo-corrected reduction in blood pressure of @/@ mm Hg .
RESULTS	Blood pressure remained reduced after @ weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	In contrast , total cerebral blood flow was unaffected by perindopril .
RESULTS	Neurological symptoms improved similarly in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Perindopril was well tolerated and effectively reduced blood pressure without reducing carotid territory blood flow in patients with symptoms of recent cerebral ischemia .

OBJECTIVE	Despite the progress that has been achieved , long-term survival rates in patients with advanced ovarian cancer are still disappointing .
OBJECTIVE	One attempt to improve results could be the addition of non-cross-resistant drugs to platinum-paclitaxel combination regimens .
OBJECTIVE	Anthracyclines were among the candidates for incorporation as a third drug into first-line regimens .
METHODS	We performed a prospectively randomized phase III study comparing carboplatin-paclitaxel ( TC ; area under the curve @/@ mg/m@ , respectively ) with epirubicin @ mg/m@ added to the same combination ( TEC ) in previously untreated patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer .
METHODS	All drugs were administered intravenously on day @ of a @-week schedule for a planned minimum of six courses .
RESULTS	Between November @ and February @ , @,@ patients were randomly assigned to receive either TC ( @ patients ) or TEC ( @ patients ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Grade @/@ hematologic and some nonhematologic toxicities ( nausea/emesis , mucositis , and infections ) occurred significantly more frequently in the TEC arm .
RESULTS	Accordingly , quality-of-life analysis showed inferiority of TEC versus TC .
RESULTS	Median progression-free survival time was @ months for the TEC arm and @ months for the TC arm ( hazard ratio [ HR ] , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median overall survival time was @ months for the TEC arm and @ months for the TC arm ( HR , @ ; @ % CI , @ to @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Similar nonsignificant differences were observed when strata were analyzed separately .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of epirubicin to TC did not improve survival or time to treatment failure in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer ; therefore , it can not be recommended for clinical use in this population .

OBJECTIVE	Targeted interventions to reduce the risk and increase the early detection of melanoma have the potential to save lives .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to assess the effect of such an intervention on patient prevention behavior .
METHODS	We conducted a pilot clustered randomized controlled trial , comparing a targeted screening and education intervention with a conventional information-based campaign in @ private surgeries in western France .
METHODS	In the intervention group , @ general practitioners identified patients at elevated risk for melanoma with a validated assessment tool , the Self-Assessment Melanoma Risk Score ( SAMScore ) , examined their skin , and counseled them using information leaflets .
METHODS	In the control group , @ general practitioners displayed a poster and the leaflets in their waiting room and examined patients ' skin at their own discretion .
METHODS	The main outcome measures were sunbathing and skin self-examinations among patients at elevated risk , assessed @ months later with a questionnaire .
RESULTS	Analyses were based on @ patients .
RESULTS	Compared with control patients , intervention patients were more likely to remember the campaign ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and to correctly identify their elevated risk of melanoma ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Furthermore , intervention patients had higher levels of prevention behaviors : they were less likely to sunbathe in the summer ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) and more likely to have performed skin self-examinations in the past year ( @ % vs @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The intervention was not associated with any clear adverse effects , although there were trends whereby intervention patients were more likely to worry about melanoma and to consult their general practitioner again about the disease .
CONCLUSIONS	The combination of use of the SAMScore and general practitioner examination and counseling during consultations is an efficient way to promote patient behaviors that may reduce melanoma risk .
CONCLUSIONS	Extending the duration of follow-up and demonstrating an impact on morbidity and mortality remain major issues for further research .

BACKGROUND	Inhaled steroids are widely used in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma .
BACKGROUND	However , long term compliance with inhaled steroids is poor and administration of a single daily dose may improve compliance .
METHODS	A double blind , randomised study was performed to determine whether inhaled steroids given once daily at bedtime are as efficacious as a twice daily regimen in the long term maintenance of moderate asthmatic patients .
METHODS	Forty adults of mean age @ years with moderate asthma ( mean ( SE ) forced expiratory volume in one second ( FEV@ ) @ ( @ ) % predicted , mean morning peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) @ l/min ) were randomised to receive either a twice daily dose ( @ micrograms morning and bedtime ) of inhaled budesonide ( group A ) or a once daily dose of @ micrograms ( group B ) and were followed for a period of @ months .
METHODS	Asthma symptom scores ( assessed according to a modified Borg scale ) , inhaled beta @ agonist consumption , and peak expiratory flow rates were recorded daily .
METHODS	Spirometry and airways responsiveness to methacholine ( PC@ ) were measured at the end of each period of three months of treatment .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the two groups at baseline and during the follow up period in the PC@ for methacholine .
RESULTS	However , a difference was seen between the two groups in the mean daily number of beta @ agonist inhalations ( @ ( @ ) puffs/patient/day in group A v @ ( @ ) in group B ) , the PEF variability ( episodes of decrease in PEF of > @ % ) ( @ ( @ ) episodes/patient/day in group A v @ ( @ ) in group B ) , and for asthma symptom scores ( @ ( @ ) in group A v @ ( @ ) in group B ) for the @ month period of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	Although both regimens provide good clinical control , twice daily doses of @ micrograms inhaled budesonide are more effective than a single dose of @ micrograms at bedtime in the long term control of stable moderate asthma .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the efficacy and safety of linagliptin in initial combination with metformin in patients with type @ diabetes .
METHODS	This @-year randomised , double-blind study was an extension of a @-month randomised controlled trial , in which adults with type @ diabetes received one of six treatment regimens ( linagliptin @ mg plus metformin @mg bid , linagliptin @ mg plus metformin mg @ bid , metformin @mg bid , metformin @mg bid , linagliptin @mg qd or placebo ) .
METHODS	In the extension , patients in the first three treatment groups continued their regimen ( non-switched group , n = @ ) while the metformin @mg bid , linagliptin @mg qd and placebo groups were re-randomised to one of the three continuing regimens ( switched group , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	All three non-switched groups maintained reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA@c ; meanstandard deviation reductions across the @-year period : linagliptin @ plus metformin @ bid , -@ % ; linagliptin @ plus metformin @ bid , -@ % ; metformin @ bid , -@ % ) while the switched groups showed additional HbA@c reductions .
RESULTS	During the extension , there were no clinically meaningful changes in body weight in any group .
RESULTS	Adverse event rates were similar between groups , with most events being mild or moderate , and the incidence of investigator-defined hypoglycaemia was low , with no severe events .
CONCLUSIONS	Initial combination of linagliptin and metformin was well tolerated over the @-year extension period , with low risk of hypoglycaemia , and improved glycaemic control vs. metformin alone .
CONCLUSIONS	The initial combination of linagliptin and metformin appears to provide a useful treatment option in patients whose blood glucose levels are increased to an extent that metformin monotherapy may not achieve treatment targets .

BACKGROUND	The curative rate of surgical resection of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus is low .
BACKGROUND	Reports on the efficacy of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy are conflicting or have included limited disease or radical surgery alone .
OBJECTIVE	The authors ' objective was to study the results of chemotherapy on the duration and quality of survival in patients who have undergone palliative surgical resection for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma .
METHODS	Of @ patients with histologically proven esophageal squamous cell carcinoma situated more than @ cm from the upper end of the esophagus , @ patients were withdrawn for failure to comply with the protocol .
METHODS	The remaining @ patients , @ males and @ females ( mean age , @ + / - @ years ) , were randomly assigned to either a control group who were to receive no chemotherapy ( @ patients ) or to a group who were to be treated with chemotherapy ( @ patients ) .
METHODS	Patients were subdivided into two strata as follows : ( @ ) stratum I , complete resection of the tumor with lymph node involvement ( @ patients ) and ( @ ) stratum ii , incomplete resection leaving macroscopic tumor tissue in situ or with metastases .
METHODS	Noninclusion criteria were histologically proven tracheobronchial involvement , esotracheal fistula , major alteration of general health status ( Karnofsky score < @ ) , cerebral or extensive ( > @ % of parenchyma ) hepatic metastasis , peritoneal carcinomatosis , associated or previously treated upper airway cancer , or , conversely , complete resection of tumor without lymph node involvement .
METHODS	Chemotherapy was given in @-day courses , every @ days , with a maximum of @ courses .
METHODS	Cisplatin was administered either as a single dose of @ mg/m@ at the beginning of the course or as @ mg/m@/day for @ days given over @ hours .
METHODS	@ - Fluorouracil ( @-FU ) ( @ mg/m@/day ) was infused over @ hours for @ days .
METHODS	The duration of treatment ranged from @ to @ months .
METHODS	The main aim was to establish median survival and actuarial survival curves .
METHODS	The subsidiary aim was to evaluate quality of survival as judged by complications due to treatment and the duration of autonomous oral feeding , that is , without palliative endoscopic treatment .
METHODS	No difference in survival was noted between the two groups , overall ( median , @ months ) , or between the strata .
METHODS	Conversely , significantly more patients in the treated group had hematologic , neurologic , and renal complications compared with the control group .
METHODS	Four patients died of complications of chemotherapy .
METHODS	The duration of autonomous oral alimentation was exactly the same in both groups ( median , @ + months ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The results of this study suggest that @-FU and cisplatin are not useful for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who have not undergone curative resection .

BACKGROUND	Atopic dermatitis has been thought to be associated with a disturbance in n-@ polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) metabolism , but randomized trials investigating the clinical efficacy of oral supplementation with gammalinolenic acid have revealed conflicting results .
OBJECTIVE	To re-investigate the proposed linkage between PUFA dysregulation and atopic dermatitis .
METHODS	Plasma levels of linoleic acid ( LA ) , gammalinolenic acid ( GLA ) , dihomogammalinolenic acid ( DGLA ) and arachidonic acid ( AA ) were measured using HPLC in @ children with atopic dermatitis .
METHODS	Patients were subdivided into those with elevated total serum IgE ( group A , n = @ , IgE > +@ SD of age-specific normal values ) and those with normal IgE ( group B , n = @ ) and compared with children suffering from allergic rhinitis/asthma ( group C , n = @ ) and with non-atopic controls ( group D , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	GLA levels were significantly lower ( p < @ ) in eczema patients with elevated IgE ( A , @ + / - @ % ) and in atopic controls ( C , @ + / - @ % ) than in eczema patients with low IgE ( B , @ + / - @ % ) and non-atopic controls ( D , @ + / - @ % ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between groups for LIN , DGLA and AA , except for lower LIN levels in atopic controls .
RESULTS	Correlation of individual LA and GLA values showed significantly steeper regression lines in low-IgE responders ( B and D , k ( x ) = @ ) than in high-IgE responders ( A and C , k ( x ) = @ ; p < @ ) , suggesting impaired delta-@-desaturase function in the latter .
RESULTS	For the study population as a whole , there was a clear negative correlation between total levels of IgE and GLA ( r ( s ) = -@ ) and a moderate negative correlation between total IgE and AA ( r ( s ) = -@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dysregulation of n-@ PUFA metabolism is neither consistently found in nor specifically associated with atopic dermatitis but rather appears to be associated with IgE production and atopy in general .
CONCLUSIONS	The finding of decreased GLA levels in eczema patients with elevated total IgE and in children with allergic rhinitis and asthma but not in eczema patients with normal total IgE questions the proposed pathophysiologic role of fatty acid dysregulation in atopic dermatitis .

###10759273
OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of two different regimens of mifepristone followed by misoprostol for medical abortion in women with menstrual delay of < or = @ days .
METHODS	Double-blind , randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Seventeen centres internationally .
METHODS	We enrolled @,@ healthy pregnant women with menstrual delay of < or = @ days who were requesting nonsurgical abortion .
METHODS	Within gestational age strata , we randomly assigned women to receive a single oral dose of mifepristone , either @ mg or @ mg , followed in @ h by misoprostol @ microg by mouth .
METHODS	We concealed the allocation assignments from investigators and participants and maintained double-blinding throughout the study .
METHODS	Complete abortion was the principal outcome measure .
METHODS	We also compared rates of side effects such as abdominal pain .
RESULTS	The complete abortion rate with the lower dose of mifepristone was similar to that with the higher dose ( @ % vs @ % ) The crude relative risk of failure to achieve complete abortion with the @ mg dose compared with the @ mg dose was @ ( @ % CI @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The likelihood of complete abortion was inversely related to gestational age , although this finding is exploratory in nature .
RESULTS	Among failures the percentage of women with continuing pregnancies increased from @ % at menstrual delay of two weeks or less to @ % when the delay was @-@ weeks .
RESULTS	Low efficacy led to stopping enrolment at @ to @ days ' menstrual delay .
RESULTS	Stopping criteria were also met at completion of the study in the group with @-@ days ' menstrual delay .
RESULTS	No significant differences emerged in the frequency of side effects between the two mifepristone groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Both regimens had similar efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	Women with a menstrual delay of four to five weeks had twice the risk of failure to abort compared with those who received treatment within two weeks of the expected menses .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy of the mifepristone-prostaglandin regimen was not reduced by decreasing the dose of mifepristone from @ mg to @ mg .
CONCLUSIONS	The regimens of @ mg or @ mg of mifepristone , followed by a single oral dose of misoprostol @ microg @ hours later , were not sufficiently efficient in inducing abortion when the menstrual delay was > @ days .

BACKGROUND	Impaired balance has a significant negative impact on mobility , functional independence , and fall risk in older adults .
BACKGROUND	Although several , well-respected balance measures are currently in use , there is limited evidence regarding the most appropriate measure to assess change in community-dwelling older adults .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare floor and ceiling effects , sensitivity to change , and responsiveness across the following balance measures in community-dwelling elderly people with functional limitations : Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment total scale ( POMA-T ) , POMA balance subscale ( POMA-B ) , and Dynamic Gait Index ( DGI ) .
METHODS	Retrospective data from a @-week exercise trial were used .
METHODS	Secondary analyses were conducted on the total sample and by subgroups of baseline functional limitation or baseline balance scores .
METHODS	Participants were @ community-dwelling older adults @ years of age or older , with functional limitations .
METHODS	Sensitivity to change was assessed using effect size , standardized response mean , and paired t tests .
METHODS	Responsiveness was assessed using minimally important difference ( MID ) estimates .
RESULTS	No floor effects were noted .
RESULTS	Ceiling effects were observed on all measures , including in people with moderate to severe functional limitations .
RESULTS	The POMA-T , POMA-B , and DGI showed significantly larger ceiling effects compared with the BBS .
RESULTS	All measures had low sensitivity to change in total sample analyses .
RESULTS	Subgroup analyses revealed significantly better sensitivity to change in people with lower compared with higher baseline balance scores .
RESULTS	Although both the total sample and lower baseline balance subgroups showed statistically significant improvement from baseline to @ weeks on all measures , only the lower balance subgroup showed change scores that consistently exceeded corresponding MID estimates .
CONCLUSIONS	This study was limited to comparing @ measures of balance , and anchor-based methods for assessing MID could not be reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Important limitations , including ceiling effects and relatively low sensitivity to change and responsiveness , were noted across all balance measures , highlighting their limited utility across the full spectrum of the community-dwelling elderly population .
CONCLUSIONS	New , more challenging measures are needed for better discrimination of balance ability in community-dwelling elderly people at higher functional levels .

OBJECTIVE	Many patients have an unpleasant recollection of routine endotracheal suctioning after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesized that through minimally invasive airway suctioning discomfort and stress may be prevented , resulting in less recollection .
METHODS	A prospective randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Two ICUs at the University Hospital of Groningen , the Netherlands .
METHODS	Adult patients with an intubation period exceeding @ h were included .
METHODS	Patients received either routine endotracheal suctioning ( RES ) or minimally invasive airway suctioning ( MIAS ) during the duration of intubation .
RESULTS	Within @ days after ICU discharge all patients were interviewed , regarding recollection and discomfort of suctioning .
RESULTS	The level of discomfort was quantified on a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
RESULTS	We analyzed data from @ patients ( RES : n = @ , and MIAS : n = @ ) .
RESULTS	A significantly lower prevalence of recollection of airway suctioning was found in the MIAS group ( @ % ) compared to the RES group ( @ % ) ( P-value = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference in level of discomfort was found between the RES and the MIAS group ( P-value = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Minimally invasive airway suctioning results in a lower prevalence of recollection of airway suction than in RES , but not in discomfort .

BACKGROUND	Rosiglitazone is an insulin-sensitizing oral agent in the thiazolidinedione class used to treat patients with type @ diabetes mellitus .
BACKGROUND	It binds to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in liver , muscle , and adipose tissue .
BACKGROUND	Ranitidine , a histamine@-receptor antagonist , may be prescribed for patients with type @ diabetes and esophageal symptoms such as heartburn .
BACKGROUND	By raising gastrointestinal pH levels , ranitidine may affect the bioavailability of coadministered drugs .
OBJECTIVE	This article presents the absolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone , as well as the effects of ranitidine on the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone .
METHODS	Healthy men were enrolled in a randomized , open-label , @-period , period-balanced crossover study of rosiglitazone and ranitidine .
METHODS	All individuals received each of @ regimens successively , separated by a @-day washout period : a single IV dose of rosiglitazone @ mg administered alone over @ hour ; a single IV dose of rosiglitazone @ mg administered over @ hour on the fourth day of treatment with oral ranitidine @ mg given every @ hours ; a single oral dose of rosiglitazone @ mg alone ; and a single oral dose of rosiglitazone @ mg on the fourth day of treatment with oral ranitidine @ mg given every @ hours .
METHODS	The primary end point was dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time @ to infinity ( AUC ( @-infinity ) ) .
METHODS	Maximum observed plasma concentration ( Cmax ) , the time at which Cmax occurred ( Tmax ) , plasma clearance ( CL ) , steady-state volume of distribution ( Vss ) , and terminal elimination half-life ( t @/@ ) were also assessed .
RESULTS	Twelve individuals were enrolled .
RESULTS	The absolute bioavailability of rosiglitazone was @ % .
RESULTS	For AUC ( @-infinity ) , the point estimate and the associated @ % CI for the ratio of ranitidine + IV rosiglitazone to IV rosiglitazone alone was @ ( range , @-@ @ ) .

OBJECTIVE	This randomized clinical trial was aimed at comparing two different means of delivering chlorhexidine digluconate ( CHX ) for plaque control during the @ weeks following implant surgery .
METHODS	Twenty patients selected for implant therapy were randomly divided into two groups : @ subjects used @ ml of @ % CHX mouthrinse ( control group ) and @ used @ % CHX spray ( test group ) .
METHODS	Professional oral hygiene was carried out immediately before surgery .
METHODS	During the @ days following surgery mechanical oral hygiene was performed only at the teeth not surgically involved .
METHODS	Plaque index ( PI ) , stain index ( SI ) , modified gingival index and taste alteration were assessed on the @th and @th day after surgery .
METHODS	The clinical parameters were evaluated at four tooth surfaces by a single examiner .
METHODS	Teeth proximal to surgical site and teeth not involved were statistically compared .
RESULTS	In both groups , the PI increased similarly , with respect to the baseline , at days @ and @ .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between the two groups at either time point .
RESULTS	On the contrary , in the control group , the SI increased significantly when compared with baseline over the @ days both at teeth nearest to surgical sites and at not-involved sites .
RESULTS	In the test group pigmentation was consistent only at teeth proximal to the surgical site .
RESULTS	When considering not-involved sites , tooth staining was significantly lower in the test with respect to the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	The present study indicates that the efficacy of CHX spray in the post-surgical control of dental plaque is similar to that of CHX mouthwash .
CONCLUSIONS	Tooth staining , however , is significantly lower in the spray group at sites not surgically involved .
CONCLUSIONS	These effects might be related to the route of CHX delivery , as well as the total dose administered that was significantly lower in the spray group with respect to the rinse group .

BACKGROUND	Noneosinophilic asthma has been regarded as a distinct phenotype characterized by a poor response to inhaled corticosteroids ( ICS ) .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether noneosinophilic , steroid-naive asthmatic subjects show an improvement in asthma control , asthma symptoms and spirometry after four weeks of treatment with ICS , and whether they further benefit from the addition of a long-acting beta-@ agonists to ICS .
METHODS	A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicentre study comparing the efficacy of placebo versus inhaled fluticasone propionate @ mcg twice daily for four weeks in mildly uncontrolled , steroid-naive asthmatic subjects with a sputum eosinophil count of @ % or less .
METHODS	This was followed by an open-label , four-week treatment period with fluticasone propionate @ mcgsalmeterol @ mcg , twice daily for all subjects .
RESULTS	After four weeks of double-blind treatment , there was a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in the mean ( SD ) Asthma Control Questionnaire score in the ICS-treated group ( n = @ ) ( decrease of @ @ ) compared with the placebo group ( n = @ ) ( decrease of @ @ ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Forced expiratory volume in @ s declined in the placebo group ( -@ @ L ) and did not change in the ICS group ( @ @ L ) after four weeks of treatment ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The open-label treatment with fluticasone propionate @ mcgsalmeterol @ mcg did not produce additional improvements in those who were previously treated for four weeks with inhaled fluticasone alone .
CONCLUSIONS	A clinically important and statistically significant response to ICS was observed in mildly uncontrolled noneosinophilic asthmatic subjects .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of Cash and Counseling on Medicaid beneficiaries ' primary informal caregivers and describe the experiences of their directly hired workers .
METHODS	Beneficiaries in Arkansas , Florida , and New Jersey voluntarily enrolled in the demonstration and were randomly assigned to direct their own Medicaid supportive services as Cash and Counseling consumers ( the treatment group ) or to rely on Medicaid services as usual ( the control group ) .
METHODS	Beneficiaries identified their primary informal caregiver during a baseline interview and their primary paid worker during a @-month follow-up interview .
METHODS	Data were collected through telephone interviews with caregivers and workers .
METHODS	These interviews were conducted about @ months after beneficiaries ' random assignment , between February @ and May @ , depending on the state .
METHODS	DATA ANALYSIS METHODS : We estimated program effects with regression and logit models and compared the mean characteristics of directly hired workers and agency workers , by state .
RESULTS	Compared with caregivers in the control group , those in the treatment group had modestly to substantially better outcomes for measures of satisfaction with care , worry , and physical and financial strain .
RESULTS	For hours of care and emotional strain , outcomes in the treatment group were similar to or somewhat better than those in the control group .
RESULTS	Directly hired workers reported greater satisfaction with wages , similar satisfaction with working conditions , and similar rates of injuries as agency workers .
RESULTS	Workers who were related to the beneficiary reported more emotional strain than agency workers .
CONCLUSIONS	Cash and Counseling can lessen some of the burden associated with caring for a child or adult with disabilities .
CONCLUSIONS	The experiences of hired workers suggest consumer direction is a sustainable option , but support networks for workers might be a welcome program improvement .

BACKGROUND	In patients with decreased resistance to infection , Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of bacteremia and its complications .
BACKGROUND	The capsular polysaccharides are essential for the pathogenesis of and immunity to S. aureus infection and are targets for vaccines .
METHODS	In a double-blind trial involving patients with end-stage renal disease who were receiving hemodialysis , we evaluated the safety , immunogenicity , and efficacy of a vaccine with S. aureus type @ and @ capsular polysaccharides conjugated to nontoxic recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A. Between April @ and August @ , @ adult patients at @ hemodialysis centers were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular injection of either vaccine or saline .
METHODS	IgG antibodies to S. aureus type @ and @ capsular polysaccharides were measured for up to two years , and episodes of S. aureus bacteremia were recorded .
METHODS	Efficacy was estimated by comparing the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia in the patients who received the vaccine with the incidence in the control patients .
RESULTS	Reactions to the vaccine were generally mild to moderate , and most resolved within two days .
RESULTS	The capsular polysaccharides elicited an antibody response of at least @ microg per milliliter ( the estimated minimal level conferring protection ) in @ percent of patients for type @ and in @ percent of patients for type @ .
RESULTS	The efficacy during weeks @ to @ was only @ percent ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , between weeks @ and @ after vaccination , S. aureus bacteremia developed in @ of @ patients in the vaccine group who could be evaluated for bacteremia , as compared with @ of @ patients in the control group ( estimate of efficacy , @ percent ; @ percent confidence interval , @ to @ percent ; nominal P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients receiving hemodialysis , a conjugate vaccine can confer partial immunity against S. aureus bacteremia for approximately @ weeks , after which protection wanes as antibody levels decrease .

OBJECTIVE	Hemorrhoidectomy is frequently associated with significant postoperative pain , and new techniques to reduce this pain are constantly under evaluation .
OBJECTIVE	The present study was conducted to determine the usefulness of the Ligasure system and compare it with conventional diathermy for hemorrhoidectomy .
METHODS	Thirty-four consecutive patients with Grade @ or @ hemorrhoids requiring surgery were recruited and randomized into two groups by preoperative assignment of sealed envelopes .
METHODS	Patients with coexisting perianal disease , previous perianal surgery , or thrombosed hemorrhoids were excluded .
METHODS	All patients were anesthetized and operated on by a single team .
METHODS	In one group , monopolar diathermy in the coagulation mode was used to dissect hemorrhoidal tissue from the internal sphincter .
METHODS	In the second group , tissue was coagulated by Ligasure and then divided with scissors .
METHODS	Operating time was documented by theater staff .
METHODS	Postoperatively , pain scores and Cleveland Clinic incontinence scores were documented .
RESULTS	Seventeen patients were randomized into each group .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in age , gender , or clinical symptoms between the groups .
RESULTS	The mean operating time in the Ligasure group was @ ( range , @-@ ) minutes compared with @ ( range , @-@ ) minutes in the other group , and this was statistically significant ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients in the Ligasure group reported significantly less pain with first defecation and at postoperative Days @ and @ ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean hospital stay in both groups was one ( range , @-@ ) day , and there was no difference in the incontinence scores .
CONCLUSIONS	Ligasure diathermy provides a superior alternative to conventional diathermy in hemorrhoidectomy by reducing operating time and postoperative pain .

OBJECTIVE	Although many animal and human studies have been performed , the exact mechanisms of action whereby modafinil promotes wakefulness are still not completely understood .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to investigate the functional effects of modafinil on motor cortex excitability in patients with narcolepsy by means of transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) techniques .
METHODS	In a double-blind and placebo-controlled design , @ drug-naive narcoleptic patients with cataplexy and @ control subjects were administered modafinil or placebo over a period of @ weeks .
METHODS	TMS was performed twice during the awake state before and at the end of treatment ; measures of cortical excitability included central motor conduction time , resting motor threshold , short latency intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) and intracortical facilitation to paired-TMS .
METHODS	TMS measures were correlated with the conventional neurophysiological method of Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ) and the subjective Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) .
RESULTS	As previously reported , motor threshold and SICI were significantly increased in patients with narcolepsy ; modafinil reversed this cortical hypoexcitability , but only SICI differences reached statistical significance .
RESULTS	The Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed the highest correlation between SICI and the MSLT ; a positive correlation was also found between SICI and the ESS , as well as between RMT and both measures of daytime sleepiness .
CONCLUSIONS	This represents the first report investigating effects of modafinil on cortical excitability in human narcolepsy .
CONCLUSIONS	Since SICI is thought to be directly related to GABA ( A ) intracortical inhibitory activity , we demonstrated that the dose of modafinil that induces a satisfactory wakefulness-promoting response in narcoleptic patients also causes decrease in GABAergic transmission .

BACKGROUND	Asthma is a prevalent and costly disease resulting in reduced quality of life for a large proportion of individuals .
BACKGROUND	Effective patient self-management is critical for improving health outcomes .
BACKGROUND	However , key aspects of self-management such as self-monitoring of behaviours and symptoms , coupled with regular feedback from the health care team , are rarely addressed or integrated into ongoing care .
BACKGROUND	Health information technology ( HIT ) provides unique opportunities to facilitate this by providing a means for two way communication and exchange of information between the patient and care team , and access to their health information , presented in personalized ways that can alert them when there is a need for action .
BACKGROUND	The objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptability and efficacy of using a web-based self-management system , My Asthma Portal ( MAP ) , linked to a case-management system on asthma control , and asthma health-related quality of life .
METHODS	The trial is a parallel multi-centered @-arm pilot randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Participants are randomly assigned to one of two conditions : a ) MAP and usual care ; or b ) usual care alone .
METHODS	Individuals will be included if they are between @ and @ , have a confirmed asthma diagnosis , and their asthma is classified as not well controlled by their physician .
METHODS	Asthma control will be evaluated by calculating the amount of fast acting beta agonists recorded as dispensed in the provincial drug database , and asthma quality of life using the Mini Asthma Related Quality of Life Questionnaire .
METHODS	Power calculations indicated a needed total sample size of @ subjects .
METHODS	Data are collected at baseline , @ , @ , and @ months post randomization .
METHODS	Recruitment started in March @ and the inclusion of patients in the trial in June @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Self-management support from the care team is critical for improving chronic disease outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the high volume of patients and time constraints during clinical visits , primary care physicians have limited time to teach and reinforce use of proven self-management strategies .
CONCLUSIONS	HIT has the potential to provide clinicians and a large number of patients with tools to support health behaviour change .

OBJECTIVE	Catecholamines ( CA ) inhibit leptin secretion .
OBJECTIVE	Alcohol appears to have a similar effect .
OBJECTIVE	The mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of alcohol is unknown , but CA may play a role as mediators .
OBJECTIVE	This hypothesis has never been tested .
OBJECTIVE	We decided to do so in the present investigation .
METHODS	Seven healthy subjects participated in two experiments ( A and B ) , performed in random order , @ week apart .
METHODS	In experiment A , three identical doses of ethanol ( @ g/kg b.w. ) were ingested at regular intervals between @:@ and @:@ hours .
METHODS	The alcohol doses were given against a background of oral placebo administered at @:@ and @:@ hours .
METHODS	In experiment B , identical doses of alcohol were ingested against a background of oral propranolol ( @ mg at @:@ and @ mg at @:@ hours ) .
METHODS	Pulse rates , and serum levels of ethanol , insulin , IGF-@ and leptin , were determined at regular intervals throughout the experiments .
METHODS	Urinary CA excretion was also determined .
RESULTS	Propranolol ( experiment B ) decreased the pulse rate significantly , compared with placebo ( experiment A ) , but did not change the urinary excretion of adrenaline nor noradrenaline .
RESULTS	Alcohol ingestion raised the serum ethanol levels similarly in the two experiments but did not affect the insulin or IGF-@ levels .
RESULTS	The serum leptin levels declined similarly in the two experiments , as evidenced by the percentage serum leptin decline from baseline , which was @ + / - @ % in experiment A and @ + / - @ % in experiment B.
CONCLUSIONS	The declining serum leptin concentration after acute ingestion of alcohol does neither appear to be CA-mediated nor to be caused by changed secretion of insulin or IGF-@ .
CONCLUSIONS	A direct inhibitory effect of alcohol on the adipocytes is possible , but increased disposal of leptin via hepatic metabolism or renal excretion could also contribute .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of gaze stability exercises to balance rehabilitation would lead to greater improvements of symptoms and postural stability in older adults with normal vestibular function who reported dizziness .
METHODS	Participants who were referred to outpatient physical therapy for dizziness were randomly assigned to the gaze stabilization ( GS ) group ( n = @ ) or control ( CON ) group ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Dizziness was defined as symptoms of unsteadiness , spinning , a sense of movement , or lightheadedness .
METHODS	Participants were evaluated at baseline and discharge on symptoms , balance confidence , visual acuity during head movement , balance , and gait measures .
METHODS	The GS group performed vestibular adaptation and substitution exercises designed to improve gaze stability , and the CON group performed placebo eye exercises designed to be vestibular neutral .
METHODS	In addition , both groups performed balance and gait exercises .
RESULTS	There were no baseline differences ( P > @ ) between the GS and CON groups in age , sex , affect , physical activity level , or any outcome measures .
RESULTS	Both groups improved significantly in all outcome measures with the exception of perceived disequilibrium .
RESULTS	However , there was a significant interaction for fall risk as measured by Dynamic Gait Index ( P = @ ) such that the GS group demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in fall risk compared with the CON group ( @ % of the GS group demonstrated a clinically significant improvement in fall risk versus @ % of the CON group ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides evidence that in older adults with symptoms of dizziness and no documented vestibular deficits , the addition of vestibular-specific gaze stability exercises to standard balance rehabilitation results in greater reduction in fall risk .

BACKGROUND	Hyperkyphosis increases the risk of falls for elderly people by reducing postural balance .
BACKGROUND	Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support are two available options for improving postural balance but have never been compared .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect of the Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support on balance in elderly people with thoracic hyperkyphosis .
METHODS	This study is a clinical trial on an accessible sample of elderly people with thoracic kyphosis .
METHODS	Eighteen participants ( @ women and @ men ) , aged @-@ years , with thoracic kyphosis greater than @ , completed the study procedure .
METHODS	Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups , namely , Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support groups .
METHODS	Sensory organization test and limits of stability were assessed using the EquiTest system and the Balance Master system , respectively .
METHODS	Balance score , directional control , and reaction time were measured to evaluate balance with and without orthosis in a random order .
RESULTS	In the posture-training support group , significant changes were observed in the studied balance parameters : balance score ( p < @ ) , directional control ( p = @ ) , and reaction time ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was a significant change in balance score ( p < @ ) and directional control ( p = @ ) in the Spinomed group .
RESULTS	However , there were no significant differences in the effect of the two orthoses , the Spinomed orthosis and posture-training support , on balance factors .
CONCLUSIONS	Both Spinomed orthosis and posture-training support may improve balance in the elderly with thoracic hyperkyphosis in a similar manner .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to compare the plaque removal efficacy of a prototype manual Deep Clean toothbrush versus an American Dental Association ( ADA ) manual toothbrush and the ADA manual toothbrush in conjunction with floss .
METHODS	This study was a randomized , examiner-blind , six-period cross-over , single-center study conducted in @ adult subjects that examined plaque removal with a prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush , an ADA reference manual toothbrush , and an ADA reference manual toothbrush followed by floss .
METHODS	During the course of this study , subjects used each treatment two times .
METHODS	Plaque was scored before and after brushing using the Rustogi Modification of the Navy Plaque Index .
METHODS	A mixed model analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) for a crossover design with baseline plaque score as the covariate was applied to the baseline minus one-minute post-brushing differences in average whole-mouth plaque scores .
METHODS	Supplemental analyses were also performed using the ANCOVA model separately for average gingival margin scores and for average interproximal scores , using the appropriate baseline score as the covariate .
METHODS	All comparisons were two-sided at the @ level of significance .
RESULTS	The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush delivered an adjusted ( via ANCOVA ) mean difference between baseline and post-brushing plaque scores of @ , while the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss delivered an adjusted mean difference of @ versus @ for the ADA manual toothbrush alone .
RESULTS	The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in plaque than the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss ( p < @ ) , which in turn had a statistically significantly greater reduction in plaque than the ADA manual toothbrush alone ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush group had , on average , @ % and @ % greater plaque removal scores than the ADA manual toothbrush alone and the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Results for the interproximal and gingival margin regions also demonstrated statistically significantly ( p < @ ) greater plaque removal for the prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush group relative to the other groups .

BACKGROUND	Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction , frequent and repetitive ventricular premature depolarizations ( VPDs ) detected on ambulatory monitoring contribute independently to the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death .
BACKGROUND	Apart from the beta-blockers , no antiarrhythmic drug has been reliably demonstrated to reduce mortality among patients with VPDs .
BACKGROUND	A pilot study was undertaken to gather data to aid in the design of a multicenter trial of amiodarone for the reduction of mortality from cardiac arrhythmias in such patients .
RESULTS	Seventy-seven patients with acute myocardial infarction within the previous @-@ days and @ or more VPDs/hr or one or more runs of ventricular tachycardia on @-hour electrocardiographic recording were randomized in a double-blind fashion in a @:@ amiodarone-to-placebo ratio .
RESULTS	The loading dose was @ mg/kg/day for @ weeks .
RESULTS	The maintenance dose was @-@ mg/day with reductions at @-month intervals in response to VPD suppression , excessive plasma levels , or toxicity .
RESULTS	VPD suppression at @ week and @ weeks was @ % and @ % , respectively , on amiodarone and @ % and @ % , respectively , on placebo .
RESULTS	Apart from thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and skin reactions , no side effects occurred more frequently with amiodarone .
RESULTS	The study drug was stopped for side effects or noncompliance in @ % of amiodarone patients and @ % of placebo patients .
RESULTS	Patients were followed for a maximum of @ years ( mean , @ months ) .
RESULTS	Arrhythmic death or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation occurred in two of @ amiodarone patients ( @ % ) and four of @ placebo patients ( @ % ) , whereas the rates of all-cause mortality were five of @ ( @ % ) and six of @ ( @ % ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Amiodarone , in moderate loading and maintenance dosages with adjustments in response to plasma levels , VPD suppression , and side effects , results in effective VPD suppression and acceptable levels of toxicity .

BACKGROUND	The role of pulsed dye lasers ( PDL ) in the treatment of childhood haemangiomas is controversial .
BACKGROUND	Our aim was to compare treatment with PDL with a wait-and-see policy .
METHODS	We did a prospective , randomised controlled trial in which we enrolled @ infants aged @-@ weeks with early haemangiomas .
METHODS	We assigned infants to PDL treatment ( n = @ ) or observation ( n = @ ) , and followed them up to age @ year .
METHODS	The main outcome measures assessed were proportion of lesions completely clear or with minimum residual signs , adverse reactions , including pigmentary disturbance and skin atrophy , complications such as ulceration and infection , proportion of children whose parents considered the haemangioma a problem , characteristics of the haemangioma , and an independent assessment of the haemangioma problem by a panel of five parents .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
RESULTS	All infants completed the study .
RESULTS	The number of children whose lesions showed complete clearance or minimum residual signs at @ year was not significantly different in the PDL treated and observation groups ( @ , @ % , vs @ , @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	However , PDL treated infants were more likely to have skin atrophy ( @ , @ % , vs @ , @ % ; p = @ ) and hypopigmentation ( @ , @ % , vs @ , @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The frequency of complications was similar between groups .
RESULTS	The only objective measure of resolution that improved with PDL treatment was haemangioma redness .
RESULTS	The number of children whose parents considered the haemangioma to be a problem at @ year did not differ much between groups ( @ of @ , @ % , vs @ of @ , @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The independent parent panel validated this result .
CONCLUSIONS	PDL treatment in uncomplicated haemangiomas is no better than a wait-and-see policy .

BACKGROUND	PS-@ is a proteasome inhibitor with preclinical activity in pancreatic cancer tumor models and synergistic activity with gemcitabine .
BACKGROUND	This randomized phase II study determined the tumor response rate ( RR ) for PS-@ alone and the @-month survival and RR for the combination of gemcitabine and PS-@ in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive @-week cycles of either arm A : PS-@ @ mg/m ( @ ) i.v. bolus ( over @ -- @ s ) on days @ , @ , @ and @ or arm B : PS-@ @ mg/m ( @ ) ( same as arm A otherwise ) plus gemcitabine @,@ mg/m ( @ ) i.v. on days @ and @ .
METHODS	Patients progressing on arm A were allowed to receive arm B treatment .
RESULTS	Arm A : @ evaluable patients were enrolled with a confirmed RR of @ % ( @ % CI @ % to @ % ) , median survival of @ months ( @ % CI @-@ @ ) , and median time to progression ( TTP ) of @ months ( @ % CI @ -- @ ) .
RESULTS	Twelve of @ evaluable patients ( @ % ) experienced at least one grade @ + AE .
RESULTS	Arm B : @ evaluable patients yielded a @-month survival rate of @ % ( @/@ , @ % CI @ % to @ % ) , median survival of @ months ( @ % CI @ -- @ ) , median TTP of @ months ( @ % CI @ -- @ ) , and confirmed RR of @ % ( @ partial responses/@ complete responses , @ % CI @ % to @ % ) .
RESULTS	Eleven of @ evaluable patients ( @ % ) experienced at least one grade @ + AE .
RESULTS	One patient had grade @ hypotension .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of PS-@ alone or in combination with gemcitabine did not result in an overall survival and RR better than that expected for gemcitabine alone .
CONCLUSIONS	Based on the lack of efficacy and the toxicity seen in our trial , there does not appear to be a role for PS-@ in pancreatic adenocarcinoma with either of the schedules used in this trial .

OBJECTIVE	The preferred approach to the management of common bile duct ( CBD ) stones is uncertain , with single-stage laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration vs. two-stage preoperative endoscopic CBD clearance followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy being debated .
OBJECTIVE	To address this , a prospective randomized study which compared these two management strategies was undertaken .
METHODS	Between Jan @ and Dec @ , patients with gallstones and common bile duct stones diagnosed by preoperative ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography were randomized to single-stage vs. two-stage treatment .
METHODS	In a single-stage group , laparoscopic cholecystectomy and CBD exploration were undertaken at the same operation , whereas in a two-stage group , endoscopic stone clearance was followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy @-@ days later .
METHODS	Early treatment success and complications and longer-term follow-up for the two groups were compared .
RESULTS	Two hundred twenty-one patients were enrolled in the trial , @ in the single-stage group and @ in the two-stage group .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in the success rate of CBD clearance ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) or the complication rates ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) between the groups .
RESULTS	However , at longer-term follow-up , recurrent CBD stones were seen more often in the two-stage group ( @ vs. @ % , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The single-stage and two-stage approaches were equally effective in achieving initial clearance of CBD stones .
CONCLUSIONS	However , recurrent CBD stones occurred more commonly in patients who had undergone two-stage treatment with initial endoscopic stone clearance , followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy .

OBJECTIVE	This study examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention for depression compared with consult-liaison care .
METHODS	A total of @ patients in a Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) primary care clinic who met the criteria for major depression or dysthymia were randomly assigned to one of the two care models .
METHODS	Under the collaborative care model , a mental health team provided a treatment plan to primary care providers , telephoned patients to encourage adherence , reviewed treatment results , and suggested modifications .
METHODS	Outcomes were assessed at three and nine months by telephone interviews .
METHODS	Health care use and costs were also assessed .
RESULTS	A significantly greater number of collaborative care patients were treated for depression and given prescriptions for antidepressants .
RESULTS	The collaborative care patients experienced an average of @ additional depression-free days over the nine months .
RESULTS	The mean incremental cost of the intervention per patient was $ @ US dollars for depression treatment and $ @ US dollars for total outpatient costs .
RESULTS	A majority of the additional expenditures were accounted for by the intervention .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $ @ US dollars per depression-free day for depression treatment costs and $ @ US dollars for total outpatient cost .
CONCLUSIONS	Better coordination and communication under collaborative care was associated with a greater number of patients being treated for depression and with moderate increases in days free of depression and in treatment cost .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional resources are needed for effective collaborative care models for depression treatment in primary care .

RESULTS	There was no difference in exercise induced increases in heart rate , but after treatment with bisoprolol the dose of salbutamol required to increase heart rate by @ beats/min was @ micrograms/kg compared with @ micrograms/kg after placebo ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The fall in diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different on the two occasions .
RESULTS	Hypokalaemia induced by salbutamol , but not hyperglycaemia or hyperinsulinaemia , was enhanced after bisoprolol .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that treatment with a beta @ blocker in vivo leads to sensitisation of cardiac beta @ adrenoreceptors but not cardiac beta @ adrenoreceptors or vascular beta @ receptors .
CONCLUSIONS	This previously unrecognised form of receptor cross sensitisation in the heart may noticeably diminish the efficacy of selective beta @ blockade in preventing arrhythmias in patients with ischaemic heart disease .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings reopen the question of which type of beta blocker is more appropriate for such patients .

BACKGROUND	Bisphosphonates can reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis , but many at-risk patients do not start or adhere to these medications .
BACKGROUND	The aims of this study are to : ( @ ) preliminarily evaluate the effect of an individualized @-year osteoporotic fracture risk calculator and decision aid ( OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE ) for postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporotic fractures ; and ( @ ) assess the feasibility and validity ( i.e. , absence of contamination ) of patient-level randomization ( vs. cluster randomization ) in pilot trials of decision aid efficacy .
METHODS	This is a protocol for a parallel , @-arm , randomized trial to compare an intervention group receiving OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE to a control group receiving usual primary care .
METHODS	Postmenopausal women with bone mineral density T-scores of < -@ , not receiving bisphosphonate therapy , and receiving care at participating primary care practices in and around Rochester , Minnesota , USA will be eligible to participate in the trial .
METHODS	We will measure the effect of OSTEOPOROSIS CHOICE on five outcomes : ( a ) patient knowledge regarding osteoporosis risk factors and treatment ; ( b ) quality of the decision-making process for both the patient and clinician ; ( c ) patient and clinician acceptability and satisfaction with the decision aid ; ( d ) rate of bisphosphonate use and adherence , and ( e ) trial processes ( e.g. , ability to recruit participants , collect patient outcomes ) .
METHODS	To capture these outcomes , we will use patient and clinician surveys following each visit and video recordings of the clinical encounters .
METHODS	These video recordings will also allow us to determine the extent to which clinicians previously exposed to the decision aid were able to recreate elements of the decision aid with control patients ( i.e. , contamination ) .
METHODS	Pharmacy prescription profiles and follow-up phone interviews will assess medication start and adherence at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot trial will provide evidence of feasibility , validity of patient randomization , and preliminary efficacy of a novel approach -- decision aids -- to improving medication adherence for postmenopausal women at risk of osteoporotic fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	The results will inform the design of a larger trial that could provide more precise estimates of the efficacy of the decision aid .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate and compare in a double-blinded and prospective study the incidence of adverse reactions between two contrast agents used for coronary angiography and ventriculography .
OBJECTIVE	The first agent was the non-ionic , dimeric , isotonic contrast medium iodixanol ( Visipaque ) , the other was the ionic dimeric contrast medium ioxaglate ( Hexabrix ) .
METHODS	A total of @ consecutive patients were randomized and received either iodixanol @ mgl/ml or ioxaglate @ mgl/ml .
METHODS	The efficacy , safety , tolerability and specific cardiovascular effects were evaluated .
METHODS	Adverse reactions were recorded during the procedure and during the first @ hours after the examination .
METHODS	Hemodynamic and electrophysiological parameters were recorded before and after the ventricular injection and the first injections into the left and right coronary artery , respectively .
RESULTS	The incidence of clinical adverse reactions was significantly different between iodixanol and ioxaglate ( @ % vs @ % , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	@ patients ( @ iodixanol ; @ ioxaglate ) experienced no discomfort ( sensation of warmth , coldness or pain ) , and the intensity of discomfort experienced by the remainder was similar for the two groups .
RESULTS	No patient reported pain .
RESULTS	During the @ minutes after injection of contrast medium , the LV end-diastolic pressure increased but , apart from one reading , the increases with iodixanol were always significantly different ( p < @ ) , and less than those for ioxaglate .
RESULTS	During the same time period , heart rate was increased to a greater extent by ioxaglate ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	QT interval was significantly ( p < @ ) prolonged with both ioxaglate and iodixanol , but the changes were less marked after iodixanol .
RESULTS	The angiographic studies were of diagnostic quality for all patients and optimal diagnostic information was achieved in @ % of both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This randomized study shows that iodixanol and ioxaglate are of comparable diagnostic efficacy in coronary angiography and ventriculography , but that iodixanol is better tolerated by patients and results in less marked hemodynamic and eletrophysiological changes than does ioxaglate .

BACKGROUND	We previously reported that a physical activity ( PA ) behavior change intervention based on the theory of planned behavior ( TPB ) increased PA and quality of life in breast cancer survivors .
OBJECTIVE	To examine the effects of our interventions on TPB variables and to determine if PA at @ weeks follow-up was mediated by TPB variables at @ weeks .
METHODS	Breast cancer survivors ( N = @ ) were randomly assigned to receive either a standard public health recommendation for PA ( SR group ) , a step pedometer alone , or one of two TPB-based behavior change interventions consisting of print materials ( alone or combined with a step pedometer ) .
METHODS	For the purpose of this study , we compared the two TPB-based intervention groups ( INT group ) to the SR group .
RESULTS	Compared to the SR group , the INT group reported more favorable changes in instrumental attitude ( mean difference = @ ; @ % CI = -@ to @ ; d = @ ; p = @ ) , intention ( mean difference = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; d = @ ; p = @ ) , and planning ( mean difference = @ ; @ % CI = @ to @ ; d = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mediation analyses indicated that both planning and intention partially mediated the effects of the intervention on PA at @ weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	Our TPB-based behavior change intervention resulted in small improvements in the TPB constructs that partially mediated the effects of our intervention on PA behavior .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional research with the TPB is warranted .

BACKGROUND	Treatments with survival benefit are greatly needed for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer .
BACKGROUND	Eribulin mesilate is a non-taxane microtubule dynamics inhibitor with a novel mode of action .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare overall survival of heavily pretreated patients receiving eribulin versus currently available treatments .
METHODS	In this phase @ open-label study , women with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer were randomly allocated ( @:@ ) to eribulin mesilate ( @ mg/m ( @ ) administered intravenously during @-@ min on days @ and @ of a @-day cycle ) or treatment of physician 's choice ( TPC ) .
METHODS	Patients had received between two and five previous chemotherapy regimens ( two or more for advanced disease ) , including an anthracycline and a taxane , unless contraindicated .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by geographical region , previous capecitabine treatment , and human epidermal growth factor receptor @ status .
METHODS	Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment allocation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population .
METHODS	This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ women were randomly allocated to treatment groups ( @ eribulin , @ TPC ) .
RESULTS	Overall survival was significantly improved in women assigned to eribulin ( median @ months , @ % CI @-@ ) compared with TPC ( @ months , @-@ ; hazard ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The most common adverse events in both groups were asthenia or fatigue ( @ [ @ % ] of @ patients on eribulin and @ [ @ % ] of @ patients on TPC at all grades ) and neutropenia ( @ [ @ % ] patients receiving eribulin and @ [ @ % ] of those on TPC at all grades ) .
RESULTS	Peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event leading to discontinuation from eribulin , occurring in @ ( @ % ) of @ patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Eribulin showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival compared with TPC in women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding challenges the notion that improved overall survival is an unrealistic expectation during evaluation of new anticancer therapies in the refractory setting .

OBJECTIVE	Although limited health literacy is estimated to affect over @ million Americans and is recognized as an important public health concern , there have been few studies examining this issue in patients with chronic kidney disease .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to characterize the prevalence of and associations of demographic and clinical characteristics with limited health literacy in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis .
METHODS	As part of a prospective clinical trial of symptom management strategies in @ patients treated with chronic hemodialysis , we assessed health literacy using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine ( REALM ) .
METHODS	We defined limited health literacy as a REALM score @ and evaluated independent associations of demographic and baseline clinical characteristics with limited health literacy using multivariable logistic regression .
RESULTS	Of the @ patients who completed the REALM , @ demonstrated limited health literacy .
RESULTS	African-American race , lower educational level , and veteran status were independently associated with limited health literacy .
RESULTS	There was no association of limited health literacy with age , gender , serologic values , dialysis adequacy , overall symptom burden , quality of life , or depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Limited health literacy is common among patients receiving chronic hemodialysis .
CONCLUSIONS	African-American race and socioeconomic factors are strong independent predictors of limited health literacy .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings can help inform the design and implementation of interventions to improve health literacy in the hemodialysis population .

OBJECTIVE	Progestins are commonly prescribed for hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and contraception .
OBJECTIVE	However , the effects of progestins on bone metabolism remain unclear and are often controversial .
METHODS	This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that progestins with no significant glucocorticoid activity may be a better choice for HRT to achieve increased beneficial effects on bone metabolism than progestins with strong glucocorticoid activity .
METHODS	A total of @ postmenopausal women aged @-@ years with osteoporosis were allocated randomly to three groups : ( @ ) conjugated oestrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate ( HRT-MPA , with significant glucocorticoid activity ) ; ( @ ) conjugated oestrogen plus norethisterone ( HRT-NET , with no significant glucocorticoid activity ) ; and ( @ ) control ( no treatment ) .
METHODS	Vertebral X-rays and bone mineral density ( BMD ) at distal @/@ radius were assessed at baseline and every @ months during the @-year study period , along with markers of bone turnover .
METHODS	The occurrence of new nonvertebral fractures was identified by X-ray .
RESULTS	After the @-year treatment , mean BMD changes relative to baseline in the HRT-MPA , HRT-NET and control groups were @ % , @ % and -@ % , respectively .
RESULTS	In addition , the rate of increase in HRT-NET was significantly greater than that in HRT-MPA ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence of new fractures during the @-year treatment in the control group was @ % ( @/@ ) .
RESULTS	HRT-NET treatment significantly inhibited the occurrence of new fractures ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) , while HRT-MPA treatment failed to show a statistically significant reduction ( RR @ , @ % CI @-@ @ , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both HRT-MPA and HRT-NET treatments significantly decreased serum osteocalcin levels by @ % and @ % , respectively , after @ months of treatment , with the decrease in HRT-MPA being significantly greater than that in HRT-NET ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that progestins with no significant glucocorticoid activity may be a better choice for HRT , resulting in increased beneficial effects on bone metabolism compared with progestins with strong glucocorticoid activity .

BACKGROUND	This randomised , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group multicentre study assessed the impact of a total daily dose of @-@ mg oral oxycodone prolonged-release ( PR ) / naloxone PR ( OXN PR ) as fixed-ratio combination for patients with opioid-induced constipation ( OIC ) having moderate-to-severe , non-malignant pain .
METHODS	During pre-randomisation patients receiving opioids for moderate-to-severe non-malignant pain were converted to oxycodone PR ( OXY PR ) and titrated to an effective analgesic dose .
METHODS	During randomisation @ patients on a stable OXY PR dose ( @-@ mg/day ) and with OIC were included in the full analysis population to receive OXN PR or OXY PR alone .
METHODS	Primary outcome was improvement in symptoms of constipation as measured by the Bowel Function Index ( BFI ) .
METHODS	Secondary/exploratory outcomes examined analgesic efficacy and other bowel function parameters .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of treatment , patients receiving OXN PR showed a significant improvement in bowel function compared with those in the OXY PR group ( -@ ; @ % CI : -@ , -@ ; p < @ ) as measured by BFI which was seen after only @ week of treatment continuing to the end of the study .
RESULTS	After @ weeks of treatment , patients receiving OXN PR had a median number of @ complete spontaneous bowel movements ( CSBM ) per week compared with only @ for OXY PR alone .
RESULTS	Laxative intake was lower in the OXN PR than the OXY PR group .
RESULTS	Furthermore , improvements in bowel function were achieved without loss of analgesic efficacy ; pain intensity scores were comparable between the groups and consistent for duration of the study .
RESULTS	Most frequently reported adverse events were consistent with those reported for opioid analgesics ; no new or unexpected adverse reactions attributable to OXN PR used in higher doses were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that the fixed-ratio combination of OXN PR is superior to OXY PR alone in terms of bowel function , while providing effective equivalent analgesia .

OBJECTIVE	To develop prognostic models for time to @-month remission and time to treatment failure after initiating antiepileptic drug monotherapy for generalised and unclassified epilepsy .
METHODS	We analysed data from the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drug ( arm B ) study , a randomised trial that compared initiating treatment with lamotrigine , topiramate and valproate in patients diagnosed with generalised or unclassified epilepsy .
METHODS	Multivariable regression modelling was used to investigate how clinical factors affect the probability of achieving @-month remission and treatment failure .
RESULTS	Significant factors in the multivariable model for time to @-month remission were having a relative with epilepsy , neurological insult , total number of tonic-clonic seizures before randomisation , seizure type and treatment .
RESULTS	Significant factors in the multivariable model for time to treatment failure were treatment history ( antiepileptic drug treatment prior to randomisation ) , EEG result , seizure type and treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	The models described within this paper can be used to identify patients most likely to achieve @-month remission and most likely to have treatment failure , aiding individual patient risk stratification and the design and analysis of future epilepsy trials .

METHODS	This was a prospective randomized control trial .
METHODS	CAPD patients with SHPT were randomized to paricalcitol or calcitriol for @ weeks .
METHODS	Serum intact iPTH , calcium , phosphate and alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) were measured at baseline and every @ weeks .
METHODS	Serum hsCRP and peritoneal membrane functions were measured at baseline and at week @ .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients were enrolled and randomized-@ to paricalcitol and @ to calcitriol .
RESULTS	Serum iPTH reduced significantly in both groups and there was no difference in the incidence of @ % reduction of iPTH between both groups .
RESULTS	There was a significant increase in serum calcium in both groups but there were no differences in serum phosphorus across the visits .
RESULTS	The incidence of hypercalcemia was the same in both groups .
RESULTS	Serum calcium-phosphorus ( Ca P ) product increased in the paricalcitol group but decreased in the calcitriol group .
RESULTS	Serum ALP decreased significantly in both groups .
RESULTS	There were also no differences in pre - and post-treatment serum hsCRP and peritoneal function test ( PFT ) in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Both oral paricalcitol and calcitriol were equally efficacious in reducing serum iPTH but were associated with significantly higher serum calcium .
CONCLUSIONS	Serum Ca P product increased in the paricalcitol group and decreased in the calcitriol group .
CONCLUSIONS	Serum hsCRP level and PFT were not affected by either treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	A larger randomized controlled trial is indicated to confirm these initial findings .

OBJECTIVE	The reduction of blood pressure ( BP ) caused by nimodipine has been proposed as an explanation for the poor results in ischemic stroke trials .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated further the relationships between BP , nimodipine , and outcome of ischemic stroke , and also searched for other possible explaining mechanisms .
METHODS	All @ participants of an earlier placebo controlled trial on oral nimodipine were included in this study .
METHODS	Among other variables , the admission BP , and the change of BP during the first day were noted .
METHODS	The @ week and @ month functional outcome was assessed with a modified Rankin grading .
RESULTS	The severity of stroke was the utmost important predictor of outcome .
RESULTS	Visible cerebral infarction on computed tomography ( CT ) was associated with severe stroke and an early commencement ( within @ h of stroke onset ) of nimodipine treatment .
RESULTS	In the nimodipine arm , high initial systolic and diastolic BP measured < or = @ h of stroke onset were independent predictors of good functional outcome ( Rankin grades @ and @ ) , whereas BP change was not .
RESULTS	The survivors in the nimodipine arm with mild to moderately severe stroke had higher initial BP than the deceased ones , in severe strokes the situation was the opposite .
CONCLUSIONS	Stroke severity , visible cerebral infarcts on CT , and early commencement of nimodipine treatment were associated .
CONCLUSIONS	Overall , high initial systolic and diastolic BP predicted a good functional outcome in patients on nimodipine .
CONCLUSIONS	In severe strokes , the combination of nimodipine and high initial BP was associated with increased risk of death .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate outcomes @ year after cessation of treatment for cocaine - and alcohol-dependent individuals .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Urban substance abuse treatment center .
METHODS	Ninety-six of @ subjects randomized to treatment .
METHODS	One of five treatments delivered over @ weeks .
METHODS	Cognitive-behavioral treatment ( CBT ) plus disulfiram ; Twelve-Step facilitation ( TSF ) plus disulfiram ; clinical management ( CM ) plus disulfiram ; CBT without disulfiram ; TSF without disulfiram .
METHODS	Percentage of days of cocaine and alcohol use during follow-up , verified by urine toxicology screens and breathalyzer tests .
RESULTS	First , as a group , participants reported significant decreases in frequency of cocaine , but not alcohol , use after the end of treatment .
RESULTS	Secondly , the main effects of disulfiram on cocaine and alcohol use were sustained during follow-up .
RESULTS	Finally , initiation of abstinence for even brief periods of time within treatment was associated with significantly better outcome during follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings support the efficacy of disulfiram with this challenging population and suggest that comparatively brief treatments that facilitate the initiation of abstinence may have long-term benefits .

BACKGROUND	Patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) techniques and intrathecal morphine are the most widely used treatments for post-Caesarean section pain .
BACKGROUND	However these methods have not been compared with respect to analgesic quality and cost differences .
METHODS	Fifty-three patients scheduled for elective or semi-urgent Caesarean section were randomized to receive for postoperative analgesia either epidural PCA with a mixture containing bupivacaine @ % and sufentanil @ microg x ml ( -@ ) or intrathecal morphine @ mg together with the spinal anaesthetic and to be supplemented with paracetamol and tramadol .
METHODS	Analgesic efficacy , side-effects and costs were calculated during @ h.
RESULTS	VAS pain scores both at rest and during mobilization were lower in the PCA group , more particularly during the second postoperative day .
RESULTS	Nausea and vomiting were more frequently registered in the morphine treated patients .
RESULTS	PCA treated patients stayed longer in the recovery room but required fewer nurse interventions on the surgical ward .
RESULTS	Manpower and drug costs were equal in both groups .
RESULTS	The differences in total costs ( Euro ) amounted to euros @ and were mainly caused by the more expensive equipment required for epidural PCA .
RESULTS	Satisfaction and hospital discharge were similar for both treatments .
CONCLUSIONS	It was concluded that epidural PCA induced better pain relief , caused less nausea/vomiting but was more expensive than intrathecal morphine .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate and compare the oral stereognostic ability and satisfaction for fixed prosthesis in human being .
METHODS	The present study was carried out on @ subjects , the purpose being to investigate the relation of oral perception to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures .
METHODS	Two types of cast metal crowns -- one had morphology closely resembling original tooth and other one confirmed to ideal contours were constructed on endodontically treated posterior tooth .
METHODS	One cast metal crown was randomly selected from two cast metal crown and fitted on prepared tooth .
METHODS	Oral stereognostic score of subject was determined by correct response to questionnaire based on the recognition ability of subjects .
METHODS	Patient satisfaction level was checked by psychometric parameter Likert scale .
METHODS	Same procedure was repeated with other type of cast metal crown .
RESULTS	Data obtained were compared by paired and unpaired two sample t-test .
RESULTS	Oral stereognostic score and satisfaction score were found to be higher for cast metal crown with morphology resembling to original tooth due to recognition and discriminatory ability of subjects and recall-memory .
RESULTS	Oral stereognostic level was found to be higher in younger than older subjects .
RESULTS	The level of satisfaction was found to be higher in older subjects than younger subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	It was concluded that acceptance of fixed prosthesis is not only based on dentist 's routine procedure of treatment and patient 's judgment about oral health , function , and esthetics , but also depends upon patient 's oral perception and discriminatory skill for external morphology of fixed prosthesis .

###22517886
OBJECTIVE	Current National Health Service cervical screening information does not explain that the cause of cervical cancer is a sexually transmitted infection ( human papillomavirus ( HPV ) ) .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to consider the impact that providing this information , in addition to risk factor information , might have on women 's perceived risk of cervical cancer .
METHODS	Female students aged @-@ years ( n = @ ) completed a web-based survey and were randomised to receive ( @ ) control information about cervical cancer ; ( @ ) details of the link between HPV and cervical cancer ; ( @ ) risk factor information or ( @ ) details about the link with HPV + risk factor information .
METHODS	Risk perceptions for cervical cancer were assessed before and after reading the information .
RESULTS	There was a significant difference in perceived risk of cervical cancer between the four groups following information exposure ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the control group , risk perceptions were significantly lower among women given risk factor information but not among those informed about HPV .
RESULTS	There were significant group by risk factor interactions for smoking status ( p < @ ) , age of first sex ( p = @ ) and number of sexual partners ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Risk perceptions were lower among women considered at low risk and given risk factor information , but there was no association between information group and perceived risk for high-risk women .
CONCLUSIONS	Providing risk factor information appears to reduce cervical cancer risk perceptions , but learning about the aetiological role of HPV appears to have no impact on risk perceptions .
CONCLUSIONS	Incorporating brief information about HPV as the cause of cervical cancer should be in addition to , rather than in place of , risk factor information .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the benefit of @ h intravenous hydration for pediatric postoperative adenotonsillectomy patients .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized controlled clinical study .
METHODS	The study is consisting of two groups of pediatric patients following adenotonsillectomy performed in a university hospital .
METHODS	One group received @ h IV hydration at hospital while the other did not have IV hydration .
METHODS	Chi-square and two-tailed unpaired Student 's t-tests were used to compare the two independent groups .
METHODS	P < @ was accepted as statistically significant .
RESULTS	Although the postoperative parameters such as nausea , fever , vomiting , odor , bleeding , otalgia and trismus were not statistically different between the two groups based on chi-square analysis ( P > @ ) , a significant pain-relieving effect was seen in hydration group after the second day ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no complications associated with intravenous hydration .
CONCLUSIONS	Results of the current study suggest that @ h IV hydration can reduce postoperative pain in late postoperative period following adenotonsillectomy in children but does not offer much advantage over without IV hydration therapy based on a number of other parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	Furthermore , it seems to be cost effective , safe and easy and even these are encouraging for further studies in the future .

OBJECTIVE	Critical limb ischemia , the most severe form of peripheral arterial disease , results in extremity amputation if left untreated .
OBJECTIVE	Endovascular recanalization of stenotic or occluded infrapopliteal arteries has recently emerged as an effective form of therapy , although the duration of patency is typically limited by restenosis .
OBJECTIVE	Recently , it has been suggested that drug-eluting stents originally developed for the coronary arteries might also be effective in preventing restenosis in the infrapopliteal arteries .
OBJECTIVE	This prospective , randomized , controlled clinical trial tested the hypothesis that treatment of infrapopliteal arterial occlusive lesions with an everolimus-eluting stent ( Xience V ) would provide superior patency to treatment with a bare-metal stent ( Multi-Link Vision ) .
METHODS	A sample size of @ patients was planned to be enrolled at five European investigative sites .
METHODS	The primary end point was arterial patency at @ months , defined as the absence of @ % restenosis based on quantitative analysis of contrast angiography .
RESULTS	Between March of @ and September of @ , @ patients were treated with Xience V and @ patients were treated with Vision .
RESULTS	After @ months , the primary patency rate after treatment with Xience V was @ % compared with @ % after treatment with Vision ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Treatment with Xience V significantly reduced mean in-stent diameter stenosis ( @ % @ % vs @ % @ % ; P < @ ) and mean in-stent late lumen loss ( @ @ vs @ @ mm ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in the percentage of patients receiving a designation of Rutherford class @ or @ at the @-month follow-up visit ( @ % for Vision , vs @ % for Xience V ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Major extremity amputations were rare in both groups ( two for Vision and one for Xience V ) .
RESULTS	The use of the Xience V stent significantly reduced the need for repeat intervention : freedom from target lesion revascularization was @ % for Xience V vs @ % for Vision ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment of the infrapopliteal occlusive lesions of critical limb ischemia with everolimus-eluting stents reduces restenosis and the need for reintervention compared with bare metal stents .

OBJECTIVE	The goal of this study was to assess azithromycin and/or benzathine penicillin for treatment of syphilis .
METHODS	In a population-based study , participants with serologic syphilis ( TRUST with TPHA confirmation ) were offered @ MU benzathine penicillin intramuscularly .
METHODS	Intervention arm participants received @ g presumptive oral azithromycin .
METHODS	We assessed cure rates with penicillin or azithromycin given alone and in combination .
METHODS	Cure assessed after @ months was defined as seroreversion or a @-fold decrease in titer .
METHODS	The rate ratio ( RR ) of cure and @ % confidence intervals ( @ % CIs ) were estimated by log binomial regression .
RESULTS	Among @ cases with syphilis , @ % received penicillin alone , @ % azithromycin only , and @ % dual treatment .
RESULTS	The overall cure rate was @ % .
RESULTS	Cure rates were lower in males compared with females ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) and in subjects with initial titers > or = @:@ compared with < or = @:@ ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant differences in cure rates among HIV-positive and HIV-negative persons .
RESULTS	With initial titers < or = @:@ , there were no differences in cure rates by treatment regimen .
RESULTS	However , with initial titers > or = @:@ , significantly higher cure rates were observed with azithromycin alone ( adjusted RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) , and with dual treatment of azithromycin and benzathine penicillin ( RR , @ ; @ % CI , @-@ @ ) compared with penicillin alone .
CONCLUSIONS	Azithromycin alone or in combination with penicillin achieved higher cure rates than penicillin alone in cases with a high initial TRUST titer .
CONCLUSIONS	In low-titer infections , the @ drug combinations were equally effective .
CONCLUSIONS	HIV status did not affect cure rates .

OBJECTIVE	Although personality factors , especially emotional suppression and loss-hopelessness , have been linked to the occurrence and progression of cancer , little is reported specifically on colorectal cancer .
OBJECTIVE	It has also been claimed that a ` hysterical ' personality characterized by exaggerated emotional expressions , egocentricity and ambivalent connection may be protective from cancer .
OBJECTIVE	This community-based case-control study examined whether personality factors relevant to emotional suppression or loss-hopelessness are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer , and whether factors related to the hysterical personality are associated with a decreased risk .
METHODS	The stress inventory ( SI ) , a self-administered questionnaire to assess the possible disease-prone and other relevant personalities in Japanese , was completed by @ patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and @ controls randomly selected in the Fukuoka area of Japan .
RESULTS	After controlling for age , sex and residence using a logistic regression model , none of the SI scales relevant to emotional suppression ( ` unfulfilled needs for acceptance ' , ` altruism ' , ` rationalizing conflicts/frustrations ' ) or loss-hopelessness ( ` low sense of control ' , ` object-dependence/loss ' , ` object-dependence/happiness ' ) was related to colorectal cancer .
RESULTS	On the other hand , two scales representing elements of the hysterical personality , ` object-dependence/ambivalence ' and ` egoism ' were protectively associated with risk .
RESULTS	Additional adjustment for body-mass index and lifestyle factors did not materially change these associations .
CONCLUSIONS	Although personalities relevant to the emotional suppression or loss-hopelessness may not be a risk factor for colorectal cancer in the Japanese population , ambivalent connection and egocentricity may be protective .

BACKGROUND	Myocardial ischemia , arrhythmias , and coagulopathies are associated with postoperative hypothermia .
BACKGROUND	This study assessed the efficacy of a novel thermoregulation system in alleviating these events during coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery .
METHODS	Elective CABG surgery patients were randomized into either Allon thermoregulation ( AT , n = @ ) or routine thermal care ( RTC , n = @ ) groups in whom the maintenance of normothermia during the nonbypass phases of the operation was compared .
METHODS	The AT used patients ' rectal temperature as reference data to monitor the maintenance of the water temperature circulating at @ degrees C in a garment .
METHODS	Rectal temperature , patient hemodynamics , and cardiac-specific troponin I ( cTnI ) levels were assessed at the induction of anesthesia , @ minutes into surgery , at discontinuation of bypass , end of surgery , and @ hours postoperatively .
RESULTS	Body temperature was higher in the AT group compared to the RTC group at all five time points .
RESULTS	Cardiac index ( CI ) ( L/min ) was higher in the AT group , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ * , @ + / - @ * , @ + / - @ * , @ + / - @ at the respective time points , compared to the RTC group , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ , @ + / - @ ( * p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) ( dyne x s ) / cm@ ) was consistently lower in the AT patients .
RESULTS	Enzyme levels were elevated in both groups but were less so in the AT patients .
CONCLUSIONS	The AT system can efficiently maintain normothermia .
CONCLUSIONS	The beneficial effects are expressed by reduced SVR , elevated CI , and lower levels of cTnI , which may show a possible attenuation of myocardial injury .

BACKGROUND	Nocturnal symptoms of asthma are a cause of significant morbidity and are included as a central feature in the categorization of asthma severity .
OBJECTIVE	Data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program were used to estimate the prevalence of nocturnal awakenings in @ children with mild-to-moderate asthma and to investigate the relationships between awakenings and peak flows , severity of asthma , and allergen sensitivity and exposure .
METHODS	Daily diary care data were recorded during a @-day interval in the Childhood Asthma Management Program screening process .
METHODS	The data on morning and evening peak flows , overall symptom codes , albuterol use for symptoms , and nocturnal awakenings for asthma symptoms were analyzed and compared with measures of personal characteristics , pulmonary function , and environmental characteristics of the patients .
RESULTS	Three hundred fifty-one ( @ % ) children experienced @ or more night awakenings caused by asthma during the @-day screening period while not taking any maintenance medications .
RESULTS	Greater risk of night awakening was associated with more severe asthma ( greater responsiveness to bronchodilator , airway reactivity to methacholine , peak flow variability , and use of albuterol for symptoms , all P < @ ) and atopy ( increased IgE and allergy skin test reactivity , both P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Those with a positive skin test response to dog and a high level of dog allergen in the home had a greater risk of night awakening caused by asthma ( P = @ ) , as did those with a positive skin test response to cat and a high level of cat allergen in the home ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mean daily symptom code and use of albuterol for asthma symptoms increased in the @ days immediately before a single awakening compared with in the @ to @ days before the awakening ( P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) ; however , both morning and evening peak flows as a percentage of personal best were similar in both intervals .
RESULTS	Mean daily symptom code and daily use of albuterol were greater in the @ days after an awakening than in the @ days before ( P < @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Mean evening peak flow percentage of personal best the day after an episode of awakening was lower when a second consecutive awakening occurred than when there was only a single awakening ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Nocturnal awakening occurred in one third of the children with mild-to-moderate asthma during a month of relative stability and appears to be an indicator of asthma that is becoming increasingly severe .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the effect and safety evaluation of catgut implantation at acupoint and drugs for levels of bone metabolism and free radicals in postmenopausal women .
METHODS	Sixty-five postmenopausal women were randomly divided into an acupoint catgut implantation group ( @ cases ) and a medication group ( @ cases ) .
METHODS	Sanyinjiao ( SP @ ) , Shenshu ( BL @ ) and Guanyuan ( CV @ ) were used as main points combined with adjunct points according to syndrome differentiation in the acupoint catgut implantation group , once two weeks .
METHODS	The medication group was treated with oral administration of @ pills of Fu fuchun capsule , once a day .
METHODS	Three months constitute one course in the both groups .
METHODS	The scores of the symptoms and signs were evaluated , and elbow vein blood was drawn to detect the correlative index on the beginning and the ending day of the treatment respectively .
METHODS	The safety of catgut implantation at acupoint was evaluated after one course of treatment .
METHODS	Besides , the sex hormone test in ovulatory period was detected in twenty-eight normal women in reproductive age with regular menstrual cycle .
RESULTS	@ ) The total effective rate of the acupoint catgut implantation group was @ % ( @/@ ) , and that of the medication group was @ % ( @/@ ) , there was no significant difference between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	The contents of bone gla protein ( BGP ) , calcitonin ( CT ) , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) and alkaline phosphatase ( AKP ) in the both groups had significant differences after treatment ( P < @ , P < @ ) ; @ ) The content of estradiol ( E@ ) in serum in the both groups was decreased more obviously than those of normal women in reproductive age ( both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The content of E@ in the both groups was obviously increased after treatment ( P < @ , P < @ ) , this function in the acupoint catgut implantation group was weaker than that of the medication group ( P < @ ) , while the incidence rate of adverse effect in the acupoint catgut implantation group was lower than that of the medication group ( P < @ ) ; @ ) There were significant differences of the level of superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) and malondialdehyde ( MDA ) before and after treatment in the acupoint catgut implantation group , the level of SOD was obviously increased after treatment ( P < @ ) , while the level of MDA decreased obviously ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Catgut implantation at acupoint can improve the low level of estrogen of postmenopausal women , with good safety .
CONCLUSIONS	It can regulate the levels of bone metabolism and free radicals of postmenopausal women , so it is very meaningful to prevent and treat postmenopausal degenerative diseases including the osteoporosis and to delay the process of apolexis .

OBJECTIVE	The identification of effective continuation and maintenance strategies for elderly patients with psychotic depression is a critical issue that has not been fully explored .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and efficacy of continuation/maintenance electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) in elderly patients with psychotic depression after acute ECT remission .
METHODS	The authors used a longitudinal , randomized , single-blind design to compare by survival analysis the @-year outcome of two subgroups of elderly patients with psychotic unipolar depression who were ECT ( plus nortriptyline ) remitters .
METHODS	One group was treated with a continuation/maintenance nortriptyline regimen ( N = @ ) and the other with combined continuation/maintenance ECT plus nortriptyline ( N = @ ) .
RESULTS	Over @ years of treatment in elderly , psychotic , unipolar depressed ECT ( plus nortriptyline ) remitters , the mean survival time was significantly longer in the combined ECT plus nortriptyline subgroup than in the nortriptyline subgroup .
RESULTS	No differences were observed between treatments with regard to tolerability .
CONCLUSIONS	This study supports the judicious use of combined continuation/maintenance ECT and antidepressant treatment in elderly patients with psychotic unipolar depression who are ECT remitters .

BACKGROUND	Segmental muscle vibration ( SMV ) improves motor performances in neurological conditions , including stroke .
OBJECTIVE	To determine if SMV modifies upper limb muscular activity in chronic stroke patients performing a reaching movement .
METHODS	We randomized @ chronic stroke patients to an experimental group ( EG ; n = @ ) , receiving @ sessions of exercise + @ Hz SMV over the biceps brachii ( BB ) and the flexor carpi ulnaris ( FCU ) muscles , or to a control group ( CG ; n = @ ) receiving exercise only .
METHODS	All subjects performed a reaching movement with the affected side before and @ weeks after therapy ended .
METHODS	We recorded surface EMG activity of the anterior deltoid ( AD ) , posterior deltoid ( PD ) , BB , triceps brachii ( TB ) , FCU and extensor carpi radialis ( ECR ) muscles .
METHODS	We calculated muscular onset times , modulation ratio , co-contractions and degree of contraction .
RESULTS	After SMV , onset times of the PD ( p = @ ) , BB ( p = @ ) and ECR ( p = @ ) in the EG were less anticipated than at baseline ; the modulation ratio increased in AD ( p = @ ) and BB ( p = @ ) ; co-contractions decreased in the pairs BB/TB ( p = @ ) , PD/BB ( p = @ ) and AD/BB ( p = @ ) ; and the degree of contraction decreased in BB ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The modulation of muscular function induced by SMV may aid to explain its action on smoothness and coordination of movements .

BACKGROUND	Studies suggest that giving newly born preterm infants sustained lung inflation ( SLI ) may decrease their need for mechanical ventilation ( MV ) and improve their respiratory outcomes .
METHODS	We randomly assigned infants born at @ weeks @ days to @ weeks @ days of gestation to receive SLI ( @ cm H@O for @ seconds ) followed by nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) or nCPAP alone in the delivery room .
METHODS	SLI and nCPAP were delivered by using a neonatal mask and a T-piece ventilator .
METHODS	The primary end point was the need for MV in the first @ hours of life .
METHODS	The secondary end points included the need for respiratory supports and survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) .
RESULTS	A total of @ infants were enrolled in the SLI group and @ in the control group .
RESULTS	Significantly fewer infants were ventilated in the first @ hours of life in the SLI group ( @ of @ [ @ % ] ) than in the control group ( @ of @ [ @ % ] ) ; unadjusted odds ratio : @ [ @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ ] ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The need for respiratory support and survival without BPD did not differ between the groups .
RESULTS	Pneumothorax occurred in @ % ( n = @ ) of infants in the control group compared with @ % ( n = @ ) in the SLI group , with an unadjusted odds ratio of @ ( @ % confidence interval : @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	SLI followed by nCPAP in the delivery room decreased the need for MV in the first @ hours of life in preterm infants at high risk of respiratory distress syndrome compared with nCPAP alone but did not decrease the need for respiratory support and the occurrence of BPD .

BACKGROUND	Gastroscopy is sometimes associated with adverse cardiovascular events .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the effects of sedation and pharyngeal anaesthesia on cardiac autonomic regulation during gastroscopy .
METHODS	Two hundred thirteen outpatients undergoing gastroscopy .
METHODS	The patients were assigned to @ groups : ( @ ) sedation with intravenous midazolam and placebo throat spray ( midazolam group ) , ( @ ) placebo sedation and pharyngeal anaesthesia with lidocaine ( lidocaine group ) , ( @ ) placebo sedation and placebo throat spray ( placebo group ) , and ( @ ) no intravenous cannula nor throat spray ( control group ) .
METHODS	Continuous electrocardiogram was recorded .
METHODS	Heart rate variability was assessed ; the powers of low frequency ( @-@ @ Hz ) and high frequency ( @-@ @ Hz ) components as well as total power ( @-@ @ Hz ) were calculated .
RESULTS	Gastroscopy was associated with a decrease in high frequency normalized units , increases in low frequency normalized units and low frequency/high frequency ratio indicating activation of sympathetic and withdrawal of vagal modulation .
RESULTS	Sympathetic activation resulted in a decrease in total power and all components of heart rate variability .
RESULTS	The decrease was most prominent in the midazolam treated patients ( p < @ vs the lidocaine group and p < @ vs placebo and control groups during the postendoscopy phase ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Gastroscopy induces a shift towards dominance of the sympathetic modulation of the heart .
CONCLUSIONS	Premedication with midazolam potentiates this shift .

OBJECTIVE	Spinal saddle block represents nearly the ideal anaesthesia technique for anorectal surgery .
OBJECTIVE	Post-dural puncture headache ( PDPH ) is a dreaded complication but can be decreased by the use of non-cutting spinal needles to rates less than @ % .
OBJECTIVE	Though , cutting Quincke type needles are still widely used for economic reasons , leading to a higher rate of PDPH .
OBJECTIVE	We performed this study to demonstrate a reduction of PDPH by the use of very small @-G compared with commonly used @-G Quincke type spinal needles .
METHODS	Two hundred sixteen adult patients ( male/female , @-@ years , ASA status I-III ) were randomised @:@ to groups , in which either a @-G or a @-G Quincke type spinal needle was used for a spinal saddle block .
METHODS	The incidence of PDPH was assessed during @ week after surgery .
RESULTS	Thirty-nine of @ patients developed PDPH but there was no difference between the two needle sizes ( @-G , n = @/@ vs. @-G , n = @/@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Women suffered significantly more from PDPH than men ( @/@ vs. @/@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Ambulatory patients had a later onset of PDPH than in-patients ( @ h [ @-@ ] vs. @ h [ @-@ ] , p = @ ) and the headache was more severe in these patients ( NRS @ [ @-@ ] vs. NRS @ [ @-@ ] , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of @-G compared with @-G Quincke needles led to no reduction of PDPH and is considerably higher compared with data from pencil-point needles .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of non-cutting or pencil-point spinal needles should become the standard for performing spinal saddle block .

BACKGROUND	Systemic sclerosis is a multisystemic connective tissue disease with marked involvement of the skin and joints for which few effective evidence based therapies are available .
BACKGROUND	To further investigate the efficacy of extracorporeal photochemotherapy on early aggressive cutaneous disease , a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was performed .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of photopheresis in the treatment of patients with systemic sclerosis ( scleroderma ) .
METHODS	This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at @ investigational sites in the United States , Canada , and Europe .
METHODS	Sixty-four patients with typical clinical and histologic findings of scleroderma , of less than @ years ' duration , were studied .
METHODS	Patients did not receive any other concomitant treatment for scleroderma .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive either active or sham photopheresis treatment on two consecutive days monthly for @ months .
METHODS	Severity of skin ( skin scores assessed in @ body regions ) and joint involvement ( @ joints examined for contractures ) were assessed on a monthly basis .
RESULTS	A statistically significant improvement in skin scores as compared with baseline was observed at @ months ( P = @ ) and @ months ( P = @ ) among those who received active photopheresis , but not among those who received sham photopheresis .
RESULTS	Comparison of skin scores between the two study arms did not achieve statistical significance because of the small sample size of the study arms .
RESULTS	Joint involvement was also significantly improved after @ months ( P = @ ) and @ months ( P = @ ) of active photopheresis when compared with baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	The study lacks sufficient statistical power to reveal a significant difference in skin and joint manifestations between the active and sham photopheresis arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Photopheresis induced significant improvement of skin and joint involvement in patients with scleroderma of recent onset ; however , any effect when compared with sham treatment and a possible placebo effect may be modest .

BACKGROUND	Many studies have observed damages to root surfaces treated by CO@ laser in continuous mode with a focused beam .
BACKGROUND	The morphologic changes observed were always associated with temperature increase induced by high energy release .
METHODS	The purpose of this study was to analyze by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) the effects of CO@ laser in @ different modes on root surfaces .
METHODS	Study samples consisted of @ extracted single-rooted periodontally compromised human teeth .
METHODS	Root specimens were randomly assigned to @ groups : group A ( @ ) treated with CO@ laser in continuous mode with a focused beam of @ mm ; group B ( @ ) treated with CO@ laser in pulsed mode with defocused beam of @ mm ; and group C ( @ ) , untreated controls .
RESULTS	Group A ( continuous mode ) showed severe damages to dentin surfaces such as craters and fissures .
RESULTS	Group B ( defocused mode ) did not result in any damages to the root surfaces , showing flat and smooth surfaces with apparent fusion of the smear layer and dentinal tubules almost completely sealed .
RESULTS	The untreated control group was characterized by irregular and amorphous surfaces with several shallow depressions .
CONCLUSIONS	Although both laser modes resulted in changes to the treated root surface specimens , the changes resulting in a smooth surface from use of defocused pulsed beam may present an advantage in periodontal treatment .

OBJECTIVE	The hypotheses that automatic , non-volitional , attentional and memory biases for addiction-related constructs exist is tested with compulsive gamblers .
METHODS	An independent groups design was employed .
METHODS	Processing of gambling , compared to neutral and drug-related information was examined in @ gamblers recruited from new members of Gamblers Anonymous .
METHODS	Comparisons were made with the performance of their spouses ( N = @ ) to help distinguish addiction mechanisms from more non-specific emotional experiences with gambling , and an independent control group ( N = @ ) , recruited from the staff and students of a university department .
METHODS	A modified Stroop procedure was first employed .
METHODS	Automative cognitive interference was assessed relatively , by comparing colour-naming times on the gambling , drug and neutral Stroops .
METHODS	A subsequent word-stem completion task of implicit memory was then used to assess selective and automatic priming of the gambling constructs in memory .
RESULTS	Only the gamblers showed selective and automatic interference for gambling-related constructs on the Stroop task .
RESULTS	Spouses behaved like the control group on this task .
RESULTS	An implicit memory bias for gambling-related words was statistically detected only in the gamblers compared to the control group , although the trend was similar in the comparison with spouses .
RESULTS	Further evidence for the specificity of these effects was obtained in subgroup comparisons involving fruit-machine with racing gamblers .
CONCLUSIONS	Results are generally consistent with an automaticity in the cognitive biases gamblers show for gambling-related information .
CONCLUSIONS	Implications for cognitive understanding and treatments are highlighted .

BACKGROUND	Methyl aminolaevulinate photodynamic therapy ( MAL-PDT ) is an effective treatment for Bowen disease ( BD ) of the lower extremities .
BACKGROUND	Er : YAG ( erbium : yttrium-aluminium-garnet ) ablative fractional laser ( AFL ) treatment removes the stratum corneum to increase MAL uptake and may improve efficacy .
BACKGROUND	However , no studies have directly compared the efficacy of MAL-PDT with and without Er : YAG AFL therapy in treating BD of the lower extremities in Asians .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcomes and safety between Er : YAG AFL-assisted MAL-PDT ( Er : YAG AFL-PDT ) and standard MAL-PDT .
METHODS	Twenty-one patients with a total of @ BD lesions randomly received either one session of Er : YAG AFL-PDT or two sessions of MAL-PDT in two symmetrical areas .
METHODS	Er : YAG AFL therapy was performed with @-@ m ablation depth , level @ coagulation , @ % treatment density and a single pulse .
METHODS	MAL cream was then applied under occlusion for @ h and illuminated with a red light-emitting diode lamp at @ J cm ( -@ ) .
METHODS	A second session of MAL-PDT was administered @ days later .
METHODS	Overall response rate , recurrence rate , cosmetic outcomes and safety were assessed at @ week , @ and @ months after treatment .
RESULTS	After @ months , Er : YAG AFL-PDT was significantly more effective ( @ % ) than MAL-PDT ( @ % ; P = @ ) , and the recurrence rate was significantly lower for Er : YAG AFL-PDT ( @ % ) than MAL-PDT ( @ % ) at @ months ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant difference was found between Er : YAG AFL-PDT and MAL-PDT in terms of cosmetic outcomes or safety .
CONCLUSIONS	Er : YAG AFL-PDT showed significantly higher efficacy and lower recurrence rate than did standard MAL-PDT for treating lower extremity BD in an Asian population .

METHODS	Three multicenter , randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging phase III studies : SHIELD , INSURE , and ENDURE .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with Behet 's uveitis ( SHIELD study ) ; @ patients with active , noninfectious , non-Behet 's uveitis ( INSURE study ) ; and @ patients with quiescent , noninfectious , non-Behet 's uveitis ( ENDURE study ) were enrolled .
METHODS	After an initial subcutaneous ( s.c. ) loading phase in each treatment arm , patients received s.c. maintenance therapy with secukinumab @ mg every @ weeks ( q@w ) , secukinumab @ mg monthly ( q@w ) , or placebo in the SHIELD study ; secukinumab @ mg q@w , secukinumab @ mg q@w , secukinumab @ mg q@w , or placebo in the INSURE study ; or secukinumab @ mg q@w , secukinumab @ mg q@w , secukinumab @ mg q@w , or placebo in the ENDURE study .
METHODS	Reduction of uveitis recurrence or vitreous haze score during withdrawal of concomitant immunosuppressive medication ( ISM ) .
METHODS	Other end points included best-corrected visual acuity , ISM use ( expressed as a standardized ISM score ) , and safety outcomes .
RESULTS	After completion or early termination of each trial , there were no statistically significant differences in uveitis recurrence between the secukinumab treatment groups and placebo groups in any study .
RESULTS	Secukinumab was associated with a significant reduction in mean total post-baseline ISM score ( P = @ ; @ mg q@w vs. placebo ) in the SHIELD study .
RESULTS	Likewise , secukinumab was associated with a greater median reduction in ISM score versus placebo in the INSURE study , although no statistical analysis of the difference was conducted because of the small sample size .
RESULTS	Overall , there was no loss in visual acuity reported in any treatment group during follow-up in all @ studies .
RESULTS	According to descriptive safety statistics , the frequencies of ocular and nonocular adverse events seemed to be slightly higher among secukinumab groups versus placebo across the @ studies .
CONCLUSIONS	The primary efficacy end points of the @ studies were not met .
CONCLUSIONS	The secondary efficacy data from these studies suggest a beneficial effect of secukinumab in reducing the use of concomitant ISM .

OBJECTIVE	Thermodilution ( TD ) is the `` gold standard method '' for hemodynamic monitoring .
OBJECTIVE	Some parameters can be measured by Oesophageal Doppler ( OD ) , which is simpler and less invasive .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the accuracy of OD , we compared this method with TD in measurement of cardiac output ( CO ) .
METHODS	One hundred and ninety two simultaneous measurements were made in @ patients ( @ male and @ female ) with different clinical situations , @ with sepsis using vasoactive drugs and @ monitored for laryngectomy and liver transplantation .
METHODS	Measurements were taken during @ hours at @ minute intervals .
METHODS	The two oesophageal dopplers used DeltexR and ArrowR , were introduced between @ and @ cm from the nose and located at the point of largest diameter of the descending aorta .
METHODS	In TD , we used the pulmonary artery catheter ( Swan Ganz BaxterR ) and the DX - @ monitorR positioning was confirmed with support of radiology and of pressures curves .
METHODS	Measurements of CO carried out by means of TD were achieved using an iced saline solution considering the mean of four measurements with less than a @ % difference .
METHODS	The statistical method used was the Bland-Altman scatter plot and dispersion graphic .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference was found between the two methods for hemodyamic measurement with a correlation coefficient of @ for CO ( Deltex DopplerR and Baxter Swan GanzR ) and a correlation coefficient of @ for CO ( Arrow DopplerR and Baxter Swan GanzR ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Homodynamic measurements with OD have the same accuracy as those with TD and were easily obtained in the @ patients .

BACKGROUND	The flavonoid components of tea have been associated in epidemiological studies with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease .
BACKGROUND	Flavonoids have been shown to have antioxidant and vasodilator effects in vitro ; we therefore postulated that drinking green or black tea attenuates the well-characterized acute pressor response to caffeine and lowers blood pressure during regular consumption .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether green and black tea can attenuate the transient pressor effect of caffeine , or lower blood pressure during regular consumption .
METHODS	In the first study , the acute effects of four hot drinks - green tea and black tea ( at a dose equivalent to four standard cups ) , water matched to the teas for caffeine content ( ` caffeine ' ) and water - were assessed in @ normotensive men using a Latin-Square designed study .
METHODS	Clinic blood pressure was measured before and @ and @ min after each drink had been ingested .
METHODS	In the second study , the effects on blood pressure of regular green and black tea ingestion were examined in @ subjects with high-normal systolic blood pressure and mild systolic hypertension ( systolic blood pressure in the range @-@ mmHg ) using a three-period crossover study .
METHODS	Five cups per day of green tea , black tea and caffeine ( in hot water and matched to the teas ) were consumed for @ days each , in random order .
METHODS	Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure was measured at the end of each seven-day intervention .
METHODS	Results are presented as means and @ % confidence intervals ( CI ) .
RESULTS	An acute pressor response to caffeine was observed .
RESULTS	Relative to caffeine , there were further acute increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure at @ min among those drinking green tea [ @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) and @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) , respectively ] and black tea [ @ mmHg ( @ % CI @ to @ ) and @ mmHg ( @ % CI @ to @ ) , respectively ] .
RESULTS	The changes in blood pressure at @ min were not significant The effect on @-h ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure of regular drinking of green tea [ increases of @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) and @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) , respectively ] or black tea [ increase of @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) and decrease of @ mmHg ( @ % CI -@ to @ ) , respectively ] was not significant relative to caffeine .
CONCLUSIONS	Contrary to our initial hypothesis , tea ingestion caused larger acute increases in blood pressure than caffeine alone .
CONCLUSIONS	However , any acute effects of tea on blood pressure did not translate into significant alterations in ambulatory blood pressure during regular tea consumption .

OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to test the safety and efficacy of a novel bioabsorbable hemostatic puncture closure device deployed through an arterial sheath .
BACKGROUND	Cardiac catheterization procedures are associated with a risk of complications at the arterial access site .
BACKGROUND	Increasing numbers of interventional procedures requiring large sheaths or intense anticoagulation underline the need for secure , rapid methods of obtaining hemostasis at the time of sheath removal .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , multicenter trial in @ patients undergoing cardiac catheterization or angioplasty at eight participating centers .
METHODS	In @ patients , hemostasis was achieved using the device ( group I ) ; @ patients were assigned to the manual pressure control group ( group II ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics .
RESULTS	Time to hemostasis was considerably shorter in group I ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ min [ mean + / - SD ] , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The deployment success rate for the device was @ % , and @ % of group I patients experienced immediate ( within @ min ) hemostasis .
RESULTS	Complication rates were lower in group I for bleeding , hematoma and occurrence of any complication .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the small incidence of pseudoaneurysm formation .
RESULTS	There was no change in either group in the ankle/brachial systolic blood pressure index .
RESULTS	Ultrasound follow-up studies @ days after device deployment revealed complete absorption of the device in all cases .
RESULTS	Subgroup analysis revealed particular benefit in patients undergoing interventional procedures .
RESULTS	The administration of heparin was associated with a significantly higher complication rate in the manual pressure control group , whereas heparin had no effect on hemostasis time or complication rates in the device group .
CONCLUSIONS	This sheath-deployed , bioabsorbable device provides a safe and effective means of obtaining rapid arterial hemostasis after cardiac catheterization procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	It appears to be particularly useful in those patients most at risk for access site complications .

BACKGROUND	Tonsillar hypertrophy contributes to pediatric disorders , including obstructive sleep apnea .
BACKGROUND	The goal was to determine the utility of digital photographs for pediatric tonsillar grading .
METHODS	Using Brodsky 's grading scale , @ children ( @-@ @ years ) had in-person tonsil grading during a routine pediatric ENT physical examination .
METHODS	Oral photographs were obtained with a standard single-lens reflex digital camera and graded by the same ENT physician and by an independent Pediatrician .
RESULTS	In-person and photograph gradings were highly correlated , but also differed significantly .
RESULTS	Yet photograph gradings did not differ between physicians , suggesting that photographs provide unique , consistent information to different clinicians .
RESULTS	Discrepancies between in-person and photograph gradings were not explained by child age .
CONCLUSIONS	Static images may provide experts more time for mental calculations and may therefore provide a superior estimation of tonsil size .
CONCLUSIONS	Photographs should be considered for remote use , as well as a potentially better alternative to current in vivo estimates .

OBJECTIVE	Exposure to the microgravity environment of space increases the risk of kidney stone formation , particularly for calcium oxalate and uric acid stones .
OBJECTIVE	This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of potassium alkali as potassium-magnesium citrate in reducing renal stone risk and bone turnover .
METHODS	This study was performed as a double-blind , placebo controlled trial .
METHODS	We studied @ normocalciuric subjects randomized to either placebo or potassium-magnesium citrate ( @ mEq potassium , @ mEq magnesium , @ mEq citrate per day ) before and during @ weeks of strict bed rest .
METHODS	The study was performed in the General Clinical Research Center and under a controlled dietary regimen composed of @ mEq of sodium , @ mg of calcium , @ gm/kg animal protein and @,@ kcal per day .
METHODS	Two @-hour urine collections were obtained under oil each week for assessment of stone risk parameters and relative saturation of calcium oxalate , brushite and undissociated uric acid .
METHODS	Blood was also collected for determination of serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone and vitamin D metabolites .
RESULTS	Bed rest promoted a rapid increase in urinary calcium excretion of approximately @ mg per day in both groups .
RESULTS	Despite this increase subjects treated with potassium-magnesium citrate demonstrated significant decreases in the relative saturation of calcium oxalate and in the concentration of undissociated uric acid compared to placebo .
RESULTS	Immunoreactive parathyroid hormone , serum @,@-dihydroxyvitamin D and intestinal calcium absorption all decreased in both groups with no difference in response between the @ treatment arms .
CONCLUSIONS	Provision of alkali as potassium-magnesium citrate is an effective countermeasure for the increased risk of renal stone disease associated with immobilization .
CONCLUSIONS	Despite an increase in urine calcium concentration , the relative saturation of calcium oxalate decreased due to citrate chelation of calcium and the concentration of undissociated uric acid decreased due to the significant increase in urine pH.

OBJECTIVE	To test the hypothesis that a community based intervention by secondary child and adolescent mental health services would be significantly more effective and less costly than a hospital based intervention .
METHODS	Open study with two randomised parallel groups .
METHODS	Two health districts in the north of England .
METHODS	Parents of @ to @ year old children with behavioural disorder who had been referred to child and adolescent mental health services .
METHODS	Parental education groups .
METHODS	Parents ' and teachers ' reports of the child 's behaviour , parental depression , parental criticism of the child , impact of the child 's behaviour on the family .
RESULTS	@ subjects were randomised to community ( n = @ ) or hospital ( n = @ ) treatment .
RESULTS	Primary outcome data were obtained on @ ( @ % ) cases a year later .
RESULTS	Intention to treat analyses showed no significant differences between the community and hospital based groups on any of the outcome measures , or on costs .
RESULTS	Parental depression was common and predicted the child 's outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Location of child mental health services may be less important than the range of services that they provide , which should include effective treatment for parents ' mental health problems .

BACKGROUND	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and therefore represents a major problem in public health .
BACKGROUND	Data from patients ' self-report questionnaires provide valuable information about the side-effects that patients may view as having a significantly detrimental impact on their quality of life ( QOL ) and yet are not always recognized as important by healthcare professionals .
BACKGROUND	Cosmetology is a specific care for patients and there is actually no scientific evidence regarding effects on QOL for women with breast cancer .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of cosmetic care on QOL in breast cancer patients during chemotherapy and radiotherapy .
METHODS	We developed a prospective , multicentre , randomized , controlled study including @ patients .
METHODS	All the patients had to fill in a French-validated dermatologic specific quality-of-life questionnaire to compare the QOL of the two groups , the cosmetic group and the control group , at three different times of the adjuvant treatment .
RESULTS	The results show a statistically significant difference between the cosmetic group and the control group in two areas of QOL : mood state and self-perception of the disease .
CONCLUSIONS	This study emphasizes the interest of cosmetic care in breast cancer patients .
CONCLUSIONS	However , further larger trials are needed to confirm this study .

BACKGROUND	Patients who fail noninvasive ventilation are generally intubated and are then subjected to complications of invasive mechanical ventilation .
BACKGROUND	With transtracheal open ventilation , ventilator support is delivered through an uncuffed small bore minitracheostomy tube , which eliminates pooling of secretions above the cuff and thus reduces the risk of tracheobronchial microbial colonization .
OBJECTIVE	To compare transtracheal open ventilation ( treatment group ) with conventional invasive ventilation ( control group ) in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who initially failed noninvasive ventilation .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive trans-tracheal open ventilation ( n = @ ) or conventional invasive ventilation ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no difference in arterial blood gases after @ and @ h between the two groups .
RESULTS	Two patients receiving transtracheal open ventilation and @ undergoing conventional ventilation had complications ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Compared with conventional ventilation , transtracheal open ventilation significantly decreased both the duration of mechanical ventilation ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ d , p < @ ) and length of stay in the intensive care unit ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ d , p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Transtracheal open ventilation was as effective as conventional ventilation in maintaining adequate gas exchange and reducing complications , duration of mechanical ventilation , and intensive care unit length of stay .

BACKGROUND	Instruction can be used to alter the biomechanical movement patterns associated with anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) injuries .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of instruction through combination ( self and expert ) feedback or self-feedback on lower extremity kinematics during the box-drop-jump task , running-stop-jump task , and sidestep-cutting maneuver over time in college-aged female athletes .
METHODS	Randomized controlled clinical trial .
METHODS	Laboratory .
METHODS	Forty-three physically active women ( age = @ @ years , height = @ @ m , mass = @ @ kg ) with no history of ACL or lower extremity injuries or surgery in the @ months before the study were assigned randomly to @ groups : self-feedback ( SE ) , combination feedback ( CB ) , or control ( CT ) .
METHODS	Participants performed a box-drop-jump task for the pretest and then received feedback about their landing mechanics .
METHODS	After the intervention , they performed an immediate posttest of the box-drop-jump task and a running-stop-jump transfer test .
METHODS	Participants returned @ month later for a retention test of each task and a sidestep-cutting maneuver .
METHODS	Kinematic data were collected with an @-camera system sampled at @ Hz .
METHODS	The independent variables were feedback group ( @ ) , test time ( @ ) , and task ( @ ) .
METHODS	The dependent variables were knee - and hip-flexion , knee-valgus , and hip - abduction kinematics at initial contact and at peak knee flexion .
RESULTS	For the box-drop-jump task , knee - and hip-flexion angles at initial contact were greater at the posttest than at the retention test ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At peak knee flexion , hip flexion was greater at the posttest than at the pretest ( P = @ ) and was greater at the retention test than at the pretest ( P = @ ) ; knee valgus was greater at the retention test than at the pretest ( P = @ ) and posttest ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Peak knee flexion was greater for the CB than the SE group ( P = @ ) during the box-drop-jump task at posttest .
RESULTS	For the running-stop-jump task at the posttest , the CB group had greater peak knee flexion than the SE and CT ( P @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results suggest that feedback involving a combination of self-feedback and expert video feedback with oral instruction effectively improved lower extremity kinematics during jump-landing tasks .

OBJECTIVE	Vestibular rehabilitation strategies mostly require a long-lasting training in stance conditions , which is finally not always successful .
OBJECTIVE	The individualized training in everyday-life conditions with an intuitive tactile neurofeedback stimulus seems to be a more promising approach .
OBJECTIVE	Hence , the present study was aimed at investigating the efficacy of a new vibrotactile neurofeedback system for vestibular rehabilitation .
METHODS	Double-blinded trial .
METHODS	One hundred five patients who experience one of the following balance disorders for more than @ months were included in the study : canal paresis , otolith disorder , removal of an acoustic neuroma , microvascular compression syndrome , Parkinson 's disease , and presbyvertigo .
METHODS	Vibrotactile neurofeedback training was performed daily ( @ min ) over @ weeks with the Vertiguard system in those @ tasks of the Standard Balance Deficit Test with the most prominent deviations from the normative values .
METHODS	Trunk and ankle sway , dizziness handicap inventory , and vestibular symptom score were measured in the verum and placebo group before the training , on the last training day and @ months later .
RESULTS	A significant reduction in trunk and ankle sway as well as in the subjective symptom scores were observed in the verum group .
RESULTS	Such an effect could not be found in any of the outcome parameters of the placebo group .
CONCLUSIONS	The vibrotactile neurofeedback training applied in the present study is a highly efficient method for the reduction of body sway in different balance disorders .
CONCLUSIONS	Because the rehabilitation program is easy to perform , not exhausting , and time saving , elderly patients and those with serious , long-lasting balance problems also can participate successfully .

BACKGROUND	Many complications were reported to be related with nasotracheal intubation .
BACKGROUND	Various chemical or mechanical techniques have been proposed to decrease hemorrhage and trauma associated with nasotracheal intubation but the results remain controversial .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a prospective , randomized , single-blind study to elucidate the effect of an endotracheal tube softened with warm water before use on the incidence and severity of epistaxis following nasotracheal intubation .
METHODS	Sixty-two healthy , ( ASA class I or II ) patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned into two groups .
METHODS	Patients in the treatment group were intubated with a softened endotracheal tube made possible by heating it in warm water while those in the control group were intubated with unsoftened ( intact ) tube .
METHODS	Epistaxis was evaluated immediately after intubation and its severity was graded as none , mild , moderate and severe .
METHODS	The use of Magill forceps and postoperative nasal morbidity were also recorded .
RESULTS	The total incidence of epistaxis in the `` unsoftened '' group was significantly higher than that of `` softened '' group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The severity of nasal hemorrhage was also significantly lightened in the `` softened '' group .
RESULTS	No technical difficulty was encountered in intubation with a softened endotracheal tube by prewarming .
RESULTS	The morbidity referable to nasal intubation , however , did not differ in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In conclusion , our study shows that using an endotracheal tube softened by warm water could reduce the incidence and severity of epistaxis during the act of nasotracheal intubation .
CONCLUSIONS	It is an effective way and worth a try .

###15541126
OBJECTIVE	To assess if a short course of antibiotics starting at the time of the removing a short-term urethral catheter decreases the incidence of subsequent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) .
METHODS	Patients across specialities with a urethral catheter in situ for > / = @ h and < / = @ days were recruited at the time of catheter removal .
METHODS	Patients were excluded if they had had recent genitourinary surgery or were on antibiotics .
METHODS	Eligible patients were randomly assigned to a @-h course of either ciprofloxacin or placebo tablets starting @ h before catheter removal .
METHODS	A catheter specimen of urine was obtained before the start of the trial medication .
METHODS	The follow-up was at @ and @ days after catheter removal , with a questionnaire for UTI symptoms , and a mid-stream urine sample was taken .
RESULTS	Forty-eight patients were recruited and had a complete follow-up ( @ received ciprofloxacin and @ placebo ) .
RESULTS	Of the ciprofloxacin group , four patients ( @ % ) had a UTI at the follow-up after catheter removal , and two were symptomatic .
RESULTS	The UTI in two patients ( including one of those symptomatic ) was newly developed after catheter removal ; the other two UTIs were a result of failure to resolve a catheter-associated UTI .
RESULTS	All these UTIs in the ciprofloxacin group were resistant to ciprofloxacin .
RESULTS	Of the placebo group , three patients ( @ % ) had a UTI at the follow-up after removal , and one patient was symptomatic .
RESULTS	The UTI , newly developed after catheter removal , was resistant to ciprofloxacin .
RESULTS	The other two patients were asymptomatic ; their UTIs were a result of failure to resolve a catheter-associated UTI , and one was resistant to ciprofloxacin .
CONCLUSIONS	The risk of UTI ( both symptomatic and asymptomatic ) after removing a urethral catheter is real , even in absence of catheter-associated UTI before removal .
CONCLUSIONS	UTIs occurring after removing a short-term urinary catheter had a high rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no detectable significant benefit in using prophylactic ciprofloxacin to reduce the UTI rate after catheter removal .

OBJECTIVE	A controversy exists regarding whether it is safe to delay radiation therapy until the completion of chemotherapy following breast-conserving surgery for patients with node-positive breast cancer .
OBJECTIVE	Within the context of two concurrent randomized clinical trials we had the opportunity to evaluate outcomes for patients who received breast irradiation after completing different durations of chemotherapy .
METHODS	From July @ to April @ the International Breast Cancer Study Group ( IBCSG ) Trial VI randomly assigned @ pre/perimenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients to receive cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , and @-fluorouracil ( CMF ) for either three consecutive courses on months @-@ , or six consecutive courses on months @-@ , both with or without reintroduction CMF .
METHODS	IBCSG Trial VII randomly assigned @ postmenopausal node-positive breast cancer patients to receive tamoxifen for @ years , or tamoxifen for @ years with three early cycles of CMF , both with or without three courses of delayed CMF .
METHODS	Both trials allowed a choice of mastectomy , or breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy , and both were stratified by type of surgery .
METHODS	Radiotherapy was delayed until the initial block of CMF was completed ; @ or @ months after surgery for pre/perimenopausal patients , and @ or @ months after surgery for postmenopausal patients .
METHODS	Over both trials , @ eligible patients elected to receive breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy : @ on Trial VI , and @ on Trial VII .
METHODS	Four-year actuarial total failure rates ( failure at any site ) , risks of developing distant metastases ( DM at any time during observation ) , and overall survival ( OS ) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method .
METHODS	To avoid potential bias due to competing causes of failure , only patients who could be followed for at least @ years ( enrolled prior to July @ , @ ) were used to evaluate the patterns of first relapse site .
METHODS	Crude percents of local failure with or without other sites ( LF ) , distant metastases including regional nodal failure ( DM/RNF ) , or other first events ( second primaries/death without recurrence ) were estimated for each treatment group .
METHODS	For this report , an intent to treat analysis was performed at a median follow-up of @ months .
RESULTS	No differences were found in the @-year actuarial total failure rates , risk of developing distant metastases , and overall survival among the two radiotherapy groups of each study .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of types of first failure and the @-year crude rates showed no treatment differences in the patterns of site of first event .
RESULTS	Estimates for the @-year crude percent of local failures were @ and @ % for pre/perimenopausal patients who had radiation therapy at @ or @ months after surgery , and @ and @ % for postmenopausal patients who had radiation therapy at @ months or @ months after surgery .
CONCLUSIONS	For node positive patients receiving breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy , the incidence of breast recurrence in the conserved ipsilateral breast within @ years was between @ and @ % for pre/perimenopausal patients and between @ and @ % for postmenopausal patients .
CONCLUSIONS	After @ months of median follow-up , administering radiation therapy after three or six cycles of CMF for pre/perimenopausal women , or after no cycles or three cycles of CMF for postmenopausal women does not influence overall efficacy or local control in this series .

BACKGROUND	Surgical treatment options for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension are complicated .
BACKGROUND	In this study , we evaluated the effectiveness of a new treatment strategy , splenic auto-transplantation and oesophageal transection anastomosis .
BACKGROUND	We report results from clinical observations , splenic immune function and portal dynamics in @ patients .
METHODS	From @ to @ , @ cirrhosis patients with portal hypertension underwent the new treatment strategy , and were followed up to compare results with those patients who underwent traditional surgical treatment .
METHODS	From @ to @ , a randomized controlled trial ( RCT ) was performed on @ patients to compare their post-operative immune function .
METHODS	From @ to @ , another RCT enrolled @ patients to compare portal dynamics using three-dimensional dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography ( @D DEC MRA ) investigation post operation .
RESULTS	Among @ patients ( mean age @ years ) , the emergency operative mortality ( @ % ) , selective operative mortality ( @ % ) , complication rate ( @ % ) , prevalence of hepatic encephalopathy ( < @ % ) , rate of portal hypertension gastritis ( PHG ) bleeding ( @ % ) , and morbidity of hepatic carcinoma ( @ % ) were similar to those patients undergoing traditional operation ; the spleen immunology function ( Tuftsin , IgM ) decreased in both groups @ months post operation , but this decrease did not reach statistical significance .
RESULTS	Through @D DCE MRA , the cross sectional area and the velocity and volume of blood flow of the main portal vein decreased significantly after operation in both groups .
RESULTS	The velocity and volume of blood flow in the auto-transplantation group was significantly lower than that in the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	Splenic auto-transplantation and esophageal transection anastomosis is a safe , effective , and reasonable treatment strategy for patients with portal hypertension with varicial bleeding .
CONCLUSIONS	It not only can correct hypersplenism , but may also achieve complete hemostasis .
CONCLUSIONS	Spleens auto-transplanted into the retroperitoneal space can preserve immune function and establish broad collateral circulation .

BACKGROUND	We hypothesised , that perioperative use of N ( @ ) - L-alanyl-L-glutamine confers cardioprotection and improves insulin resistance in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease operated under cardiopulmonary bypass .
METHODS	This double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomised study included @ patients with diabetes mellitus type @ who were scheduled for on-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery .
METHODS	The protocol group ( @ patients ) and the control group ( @ patients ) glutamine ( @ g/kg/day of @ % solution of N ( @ ) - L-alanyl-L-glutamine ( `` Dipeptiven ( ) '' Fresenius Kabi , Germany ) ) and placebo ( @ % NaCl ) , respectively .
METHODS	Perioperative concentration of troponin I in plasma was considered as the primary end-point .
METHODS	Whereas the secondary end-points were insulin resistance , insulin sensitivity , - cell function , blood glucose , plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids concentrations .
METHODS	Insulin resistance , insulin sensitivity and - cell function were measured using HOMA equation .
METHODS	Thermodilution method was used to measure haemodynamics in all the patients .
RESULTS	No differences have been found in perioperative dynamics of troponin I , insulin resistance , insulin sensitivity , - cell function , blood glucose , plasma triglycerides free fatty acids concentrations and haemodynamics .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results have failed to confirm the cardioprotective properties and modulatory effect on perioperative insulin resistance that are thought to be attributable to parenteral glutamine administration in dose @ g/kg/day among cardiac patients with DM operated on under CPB .

OBJECTIVE	Although cross-sectional studies have demonstrated poor adherence to airway clearance therapy ( ACT ) for patients with cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , no studies have identified longitudinal patterns of adherence .
OBJECTIVE	The objective was to characterize and identify predictors of ACT adherence trajectories for individuals with CF.
METHODS	Secondary data analyses were conducted for a randomized clinical trial examining differences in three ACTs .
METHODS	Participants ( n = @ ; M = @ years , @ % male , @ % Caucasian , baseline FEV ( @ ) % predicted : M = @ ) / primary caregivers completed Daily Phone Diaries , an empirically supported adherence measure , every @ months .
RESULTS	Group-based trajectory modeling revealed the best-fitting solution was a three-group model : low-adherence ( @ % ) , medium-adherence ( @ % ) , and high-adherence ( @ % ) groups .
RESULTS	ACT type was the only significant predictor of adherence trajectories .
CONCLUSIONS	Three trajectories of adherence to ACT for patients with CF were found .
CONCLUSIONS	With the identification of trajectories , adherence interventions can be targeted for the subgroup at highest risk in order to prevent poor health outcomes .

BACKGROUND	In persons without clinical symptom it is difficult to assess an impact of probiotics regarding its effect on health .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated the functional efficacy of the probiotic Lactobacillus fermentum ME-@ in healthy volunteers by measuring the influence of two different formulations on intestinal lactoflora , fecal recovery of the probiotic strain and oxidative stress markers of blood and urine after @ weeks consumption .
METHODS	Two @-week healthy volunteer trials were performed .
METHODS	Open placebo controlled ( OPC ) study participants ( n = @ ) consumed either goat milk or by L. fermentum ME-@ fermented goat milk ( daily dose @ log CFU ( Colony Forming Units ) .
METHODS	Double blind randomised placebo controlled ( DBRP ) study participants ( n = @ ) received either capsules with L. fermentum ME-@ ( daily of dose @ CFU ) or placebo capsules .
METHODS	The faecal lactoflora composition , faecal ME-@ recovery , effect of the consumption on intestinal lactoflora , and oxidative stress markers of blood ( total antioxidative activity ; total antioxidative status and glutathione red-ox ratio ) was measured .
RESULTS	ME-@ was well tolerated and a significant increase in total faecal lactobacilli yet no predominance of ME-@ was detected in all study groups .
RESULTS	Faecal recovery of ME-@ was documented by molecular methods only in fermented milk group , however the significant improvement of blood TAA ( Total Antioxidative Activity ) and TAS ( Total Antioxidative Status ) indices was seen both in case of fermented goat milk and capsules '' , yet glutathione re-ox ratio values decreased only in case of fermented by ME-@ goat milk .
CONCLUSIONS	The functional efficacy of both consumed formulations of an antioxidative probiotic L. fermentum ME-@ is proved by the increase of the intestinal lactobacilli counts providing putative defence against enteric infections and by reduction of the oxidative stress indices of blood and urine of healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	In non-diseased host the probiotic health claims can be assessed by improvement of some measurable laboratory indices of well-established physiological functions of host , e.g. markers of antioxidative defence system .

BACKGROUND	Several previous studies have demonstrated that bone mineral density loss around femoral implants is common , particularly in the proximal part of the femur , soon after total hip arthroplasty .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of alendronate and alfacalcidol on bone mineral density loss around the femoral implant and in the lumbar spine after total hip arthroplasty .
METHODS	The present study included sixty patients with osteoarthritis of the hip who had undergone a primary cementless total hip arthroplasty .
METHODS	We assigned these individuals to treatment with alendronate ( n = @ ) , alfacalcidol ( n = @ ) , or no medication ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Periprosthetic and lumbar spine bone mineral density was measured one week after surgery , and biochemical markers ( bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and serum N-terminal telopeptides of type-@ collagen ) were measured before surgery as a reference baseline .
METHODS	Subsequent measurements were performed at twelve , twenty-four , and forty-eight weeks after surgery .
METHODS	The periprosthetic measurement area in the femur was defined as Regions @ to @ , which are consecutively located around the implant from the greater trochanter to the lesser trochanter and calcar .
RESULTS	Bone mineral density in the alendronate group was maintained in all regions .
RESULTS	In the alfacalcidol and no-medication groups , bone mineral density in Region @ was lower than in Regions @ to @ throughout the study period ( p < @ as a result of repeated measures analysis of variance ) .
RESULTS	Bone mineral density in the lumbar spine in the alendronate and alfacalcidol groups was higher than in the no-medication group at forty-eight weeks .
RESULTS	The serum level of N-terminal telopeptides of type-@ collagen in the alendronate group was lower than that in the no-medication group throughout the study period ( p = @ , @ and @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Alendronate prevented bone mineral density loss around femoral implants , particularly in Region @ ( calcar ) , but alfacalcidol did not show any effects in any regions .
CONCLUSIONS	However , bone mineral density losses in the lumbar spine were effectively prevented by either alendronate or alfacalcidol .

BACKGROUND	It is unclear whether recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH ) improves linear growth in children with Crohn 's disease ( CD ) .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the effects of rhGH on height velocity ( HV ) and glucose homeostasis over a @-month period .
METHODS	Randomized controlled trial in two tertiary children 's hospitals in @ children with inflammatory bowel disease amongst whom @ had CD .
METHODS	Duration of disease from diagnosis and number of acute relapses requiring either exclusive enteral nutrition or therapeutic dose of oral prednisolone were similar in the treatment and control groups .
METHODS	Either rhGH ( @ mg/kg per day ) as daily subcutaneous injections ( rhGH group ; n , @ ) or no rhGH , ( Ctrl ; n , @ ) for @ months .
METHODS	Percentage change in HV after @ months in the two groups .
METHODS	Auxology , puberty , skeletal age , disease factors , treatment and glucose homeostasis were also assessed .
RESULTS	Median HV increased from @ ( range , @ , @ ) at baseline to @ ( @ , @ ) cm/year at @ month ( P = @ ) in the rhGH group , whereas in the Ctrl group , it was @ ( @ , @ ) and @ cm/year ( @ , @ ) , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Median percentage increase in HV after @ months in the rhGH group was @ % ( @ , @ ) compared with @ % ( -@ % , @ % ) in the Ctrl group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences in disease activity and proinflammatory cytokines at baseline and @ months in both groups and change in bone age for chronological age was also similar in the two groups .
RESULTS	In the rhGH group , fasting insulin increased from @ ( @ , @ ) to @ mU/l ( @ , @ ) ( P = @ ) , whereas in the Ctrl group , it was @ ( @ , @ ) and @ mU/l ( @ , @ ) ( P = @ ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Although this pilot trial shows that rhGH can improve short-term linear growth in children with CD , the clinical efficacy of this therapy needs to be further studied in longer-term studies of growth , glucose homeostasis and disease status .

###23733781
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the prognostic value of minimal residual disease ( MRD ) assessment in patients with multiple myeloma treated in the MRC ( Medical Research Council ) Myeloma IX trial .
METHODS	Multiparameter flow cytometry ( MFC ) was used to assess MRD after induction therapy ( n = @ ) and at day @ after autologous stem-cell transplantation ( ASCT ; n = @ ) in intensive-pathway patients and at the end of induction therapy in non-intensive-pathway patients ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	In intensive-pathway patients , absence of MRD at day @ after ASCT was highly predictive of a favorable outcome ( PFS , P < @ ; OS , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	This outcome advantage was demonstrable in patients with favorable and adverse cytogenetics ( PFS , P = @ and P < @ , respectively ) and in patients achieving immunofixation-negative complete response ( CR ; PFS , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The effect of maintenance thalidomide was assessed , with the shortest PFS demonstrable in those MRD-positive patients who did not receive maintenance and longest in those who were MRD negative and did receive thalidomide ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Further analysis demonstrated that @ % of MRD-positive patients who received maintenance thalidomide became MRD negative .
RESULTS	MRD assessment after induction therapy in the non-intensive-pathway patients did not seem to be predictive of outcome ( PFS , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	MRD assessment by MFC was predictive of overall outcome in patients with myeloma undergoing ASCT .
CONCLUSIONS	This predictive value was seen in patients achieving conventional CR as well as patients with favorable and adverse cytogenetics .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects of maintenance strategies can also be evaluated , and our data suggest that maintenance thalidomide can eradicate MRD in some patients .

BACKGROUND	Vitamin A is important for protection against diarrhea , and supplements may benefit gut function of infants of HIV-infected mothers .
METHODS	We studied @ infants of HIV-infected South African women participating in a randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of vitamin A during pregnancy ( @ mg retinyl palmitate and @ mg beta-carotene daily ) plus @ mg retinyl palmitate at delivery .
METHODS	The placebo group received identical placebo capsules at the same times .
METHODS	When infants were @ , @ , and @ weeks of age , lactulose/mannitol dual sugar intestinal permeability tests were performed .
RESULTS	Maternal vitamin A supplementation did not significantly affect infant gut permeability in the group as a whole at any time .
RESULTS	By multiple regression analysis , HIV infection of the infant by @ weeks was significantly associated with increased gut permeability at both @ and @ weeks .
RESULTS	After controlling for birth weight , gestational age , current weight , feeding mode and recent morbidity , there was a trend toward an interaction between vitamin A supplementation and HIV infection ( P = @ ) at @ weeks .
RESULTS	Vitamin A made no difference to gut permeability of uninfected infants ( lactulose/mannitol ratio for vitamin A group : @ , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] @ , @ , n = @ and for placebo group : @ , @ % CI @ , @ , n = @ ) , but largely prevented the increase in the ratio of HIV-infected infants ( vitamin A group : @ , @ % CI @ , @ , n = @ ; placebo group : @ , @ % CI @ , @ , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The effects on the lactulose/mannitol ratio were related to changes in lactulose , not mannitol , excretion .
RESULTS	Vitamin A supplementation was associated with significantly lower lactulose excretion at @ and @ weeks , suggesting the major effect of vitamin A was on maintaining the integrity of gut tight junctions .
CONCLUSIONS	Vitamin A supplementation of HIV-infected pregnant women may prevent the deterioration in gut integrity in the subgroup of their infants who themselves become infected .
CONCLUSIONS	Improving vitamin A status of HIV-infected infants may decrease their gastrointestinal morbidity .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of this work is to analyze , by means of noninvasive monitoring , the clinical effects of high intraperitoneal pressure for enough time to insert the first trocar .
METHODS	Sixty-seven patients without significant lung problems were randomly divided into groups P@ ( n = @ , maximum intraperitoneal pressure @ mmHg ) and P@ ( n = @ , maximum intraperitoneal pressure @ mmHg ) .
METHODS	A Veress needle was inserted into the left hypochondrium for creation of pneumoperitoneum .
METHODS	The parameters evaluated were heart rate ( HR , in bpm ) , arterial oxygen saturation ( SaO ( @ ) , expressed as percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen ) , end-tidal CO ( @ ) ( ETCO ( @ ) , in mmHg ) , mean arterial pressure ( MAP , in mmHg ) , and intratracheal pressure ( ITP , in cmH ( @ ) O ) .
METHODS	Clinical parameters were evaluated in both groups at time point @ ( TP@ , before CO ( @ ) insufflation ) , time point @ ( TP@ , when intraperitoneal pressure of @ mmHg was reached in both groups ) , time point @ ( TP@ , @ min after reaching intraperitoneal pressure of @ mmHg in group P@ and of @ mmHg in group P@ ) , and time point @ ( TP@ , @ min after reaching intraperitoneal pressure of @ mmHg in group P@ and @ min after TP@ in group P@ , when intraperitoneal pressure decreased from @ to @ mmHg ) .
METHODS	Values outside of the normal range or occurrence of atypical phenomena suggestive of organic disease indicated clinical changes .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding HR , MAP , ETCO ( @ ) , and ITP .
RESULTS	No significant clinical changes were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Transitory , high intraperitoneal pressure ( @ mmHg for @ min ) for insertion of the first trocar resulted in changes in HR , MAP , ETCO ( @ ) , and ITP that were within the normal range , and no adverse clinical effects were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , the use of transitory , high intraperitoneal pressure is recommended to prevent iatrogenic injury during blind insertion of the first trocar .
CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , it is not clear that this method would be safe in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the association of cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) viremia with mortality and CMV retinitis progression in newly diagnosed and relapsed CMV retinitis .
METHODS	Ancillary study of a randomized , placebo-controlled , phase III clinical trial .
METHODS	A total of @ patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis , enrolled during the first phase of the Monoclonal Antibody Cytomegalovirus Retinitis Trial , were administered MSL-@ or placebo as adjuvant therapy for CMV retinitis .
METHODS	Mortality and CMV retinitis progression .
RESULTS	Treatment with MSL-@ did not predict either progression of CMV retinitis or mortality .
RESULTS	Detection in plasma CMV DNA at baseline predicted mortality , but CMV antigenemia did not .
RESULTS	CMV DNA was a better predictor of mortality than a high HIV viral load .
RESULTS	Neither CMV DNA nor antigenemia predicted the progression of CMV retinitis .
RESULTS	Among newly diagnosed patients , there was a decline in the proportion with detectable CMV viral load and CMV antigenemia in response to anti-CMV therapy .
RESULTS	However , there was a rebound in CMV viral load to @ % and CMV antigenemia to @ % at @ months .
RESULTS	In relapsed patients , anti-CMV therapy was not associated with a change in the percentage with detectable CMV-DNA or CMV antigenemia over time .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with AIDS and CMV retinitis , the detection of plasma CMV DNA was associated with a higher risk of mortality than was a high HIV viral load .
CONCLUSIONS	Anti-CMV therapy provided a transient reduction in CMV viremia in newly diagnosed but not relapsed patients with CMV retinitis .
CONCLUSIONS	Adjuvant therapy with MSL-@ was ineffective in clearing CMV-DNA and CMV antigen from the plasma .

BACKGROUND	Aromatase inhibitors are widely employed in the adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer .
BACKGROUND	The impact of aromatase inhibitors has not been established in ethnic minority women .
METHODS	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of letrozole on minority women in MA @ , a placebo-controlled trial of letrozole following @ years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer .
METHODS	Retrospective comparison of disease-free survival ( DFS ) , side effects , and mean changes in quality of life ( QOL ) scores from baseline between Caucasian and minority women was performed .
RESULTS	Minority ( n = @ ) and Caucasian ( n = @ ) women were analyzed .
RESULTS	There was no difference between these groups in DFS ( @ % versus @ % respectively for @ year DFS ) .
RESULTS	Letrozole , compared with placebo , significantly improved DFS for Caucasians ( HR = @ ; P < @ ) but not for minorities ( HR = @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among women who received letrozole , minorities had a significantly lower incidence of hot flashes ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , fatigue ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) , and arthritis ( @ % versus @ % ; P = @ ) compared with Caucasians .
RESULTS	Mean change in QOL scores for minority women who received letrozole demonstrated improved mental health at the @-month assessment ( P = @ ) and less bodily pain at the @-month assessment ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Letrozole improved DFS in Caucasians but a definite benefit in minority women has not yet been demonstrated .
CONCLUSIONS	Minority women tolerated letrozole better than Caucasians in terms of toxicity .
CONCLUSIONS	These results need confirmation in other trials of aromatase inhibitors .

OBJECTIVE	Pilot study to compare the effect of inhaled nitric oxide ( iNO ) and aerosolized iloprost in preventing perioperative pulmonary hypertensive crises ( PHTCs ) .
BACKGROUND	Guidelines recommend the use of iNO to treat PHTCs , but treatment with iNO is not an ideal vasodilator .
BACKGROUND	Aerosolized iloprost may be a possible alternative to iNO in this setting .
METHODS	Investigator-initiated , open-label , randomized clinical trial in @ infants ( age range @-@days ) with left-to-right shunt ( @ out of @ with additional trisomy @ ) , and pulmonary hypertension ( i.e. mean pulmonary artery pressure [ PAP ] > @mmHg ) after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to treatment with iNO at @ppm or aerosolized iloprost at @ g/kg ( every @h ) .
METHODS	The observation period was @h after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the occurrence of PHTCs ; the secondary endpoints were mean PAP , duration of mechanical ventilation , safety of administration , and in-hospital mortality .
RESULTS	Seven patients received iNO and eight patients received iloprost .
RESULTS	During the observation period , @ of the @ patients had at least one major or minor PHTC .
RESULTS	There was no difference between the groups with regard to the frequency of PHTCs , mean PAP and duration of mechanical ventilation ( p > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In this pilot study , aerosolized iloprost had a favorable safety profile .
CONCLUSIONS	Larger trials are needed to compare its efficacy to iNO for the treatment of perioperative pulmonary hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	However , neither treatment alone abolished the occurrence of PHTCs .

OBJECTIVE	To compare aqueous humor pH values in patients during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery with patients during conventional phacoemulsification .
METHODS	A prospective clinical study was conducted in @ eyes of @ patients who underwent cataract surgery by a single surgeon .
METHODS	The femtosecond laser group included @ eyes operated on with a femtosecond laser platform ( Catalys ; Abbott Medical Optics , Santa Ana , CA ) and the phacoemulsification group included @ eyes that were operated on with conventional phacoemulsification .
METHODS	The femtosecond laser group was subdivided into low , medium , and high level of cavitation gas bubbles after docking and the femtosecond laser procedure , according to the judgment of the surgeon .
METHODS	Aqueous humor samples ( @ to @ mL ) were collected through a paracentesis from each patient after docking , corneal incisions , and nucleus fragmentation in the femtosecond laser group and after corneal incisions but before injection of viscoelastic in the phacoemulsification group , then analyzed with a pH meter .
RESULTS	The mean pH was @ @ ( range : @ to @ ) and @ @ ( range : @ to @ ) in the femtosecond laser and phacoemulsification groups , respectively ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	In the femtosecond laser group , no significant differences in pH were observed between the three subgroups after docking and the femtosecond laser surgical procedure : low ( @ @ [ range : @ to @ ] ) , medium ( @ @ [ range : @ to @ ] ) , and high ( @ @ [ range : @ to @ ] ) level of gas bubbles .
CONCLUSIONS	Cavitation bubbles derived from the photodisruption process in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery lead to an acidic shift of the aqueous humor pH as a result of the transformation of carbon dioxide to carbonic acid .
CONCLUSIONS	The level of gas bubbles visible after the laser photodisruption does not seem to correlate with this pH shift .
CONCLUSIONS	Further analysis of femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery is necessary .

BACKGROUND	Antibiotic prophylaxis in transurethral resection of the prostate is a regular practice in urology .
BACKGROUND	However , its prophylactic effect can be questioned when the antiseptic surgical technique is used .
BACKGROUND	Nonetheless , urine culture-oriented antibiotic therapy is the gold standard for avoiding improper medication usage and bacterial resistance .
OBJECTIVE	To study the efficacy of antibiotic usage in patients with negative urine cultures , who were submitted to transurethral resection of the prostate .
METHODS	Prospective open labeled study .
METHODS	Tertiary care referral hospital .
METHODS	@ consecutive patients , who were randomly divided into two groups to receive antibiotic prophylaxis or not .
METHODS	Cultures from meatus , urine , irrigation and antiseptic fluid , and prostate tissue chips , were compared and analyzed for bacterial sensitivity to the antibiotic used , according to the surgeon 's personal criteria .
METHODS	McLennan 's test was used for statistical analysis .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference regarding clinical evolution was found between the groups that received or antibiotics or not .
RESULTS	Statistical significance was found regarding the occurrence of positive urine cultures during the postoperative period for those not receiving antibiotics , but not in relation to fever , prostate chip culture or bacteremic episodes .
RESULTS	Sixty-eight subjects ( @ % ) presented positive prostatic tissue culture .
RESULTS	There was no specific correlation between the recovered bacteria from the meatus , prostatic tissue chip and urine and the spectrum of the administered antibiotic .
RESULTS	Six cases showed the same bacteria in the urine and prostatic tissue chip .
RESULTS	Only fifteen cases ( @ % ) in the antibiotic group showed the desired sensitivity directed to the collected bacteria .
CONCLUSIONS	Antibiotic prophylaxis for patients whose urine is sterile is debatable in patients who are candidates for transurethral resection of the prostate .
CONCLUSIONS	Most of the time , the antibiotic agent used is not specific for any of the bacteria recovered from the various sources analyzed .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted , nonpharmaceutical intervention on incidence of falls and fallers .
METHODS	Prospective , cluster-randomized , controlled @-month trial .
METHODS	Six community nursing homes in Germany .
METHODS	Long-stay residents ( n = @ ) aged @ and older ; mean age @ ; @ % female .
METHODS	Staff and resident education on fall prevention , advice on environmental adaptations , progressive balance and resistance training , and hip protectors .
METHODS	Falls , fallers , and fractures .
RESULTS	The incidence density rate of falls per @,@ resident years ( RY ) was @,@ for the control group ( CG ) and @,@ for the intervention group ( IG ) ( relative risk ( RR ) = @ , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Two hundred forty-seven ( @ % ) fallers were detected in the CG and @ ( @ % ) in the IG ( RR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence density rate of frequent fallers ( > @/year ) was @ ( @ % ) for the CG and @ ( @ % ) for the IG ( RR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence density rate of hip fractures per @,@ RY was @ for the CG and @ for the IG ( RR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Other fractures were diagnosed with an incidence density rate of @ per @,@ RY for CG and @ per @,@ RY for IG ( RR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The incidence density rate of falls and fallers differed considerably between the control and intervention groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The study was underpowered to demonstrate a significant difference of hip or nonhip fractures .
CONCLUSIONS	Because of a low fracture rate in both groups , the investigation of fracture rates would have required a larger sample size to detect an effect of the intervention .

OBJECTIVE	We compared the efficacy , safety , and immunogenicity of a rhesus rotavirus tetravalent vaccine ( RRV-TV ) , a rhesus rotavirus monovalent ( serotype @ ) vaccine ( RRV-S@ ) , and placebo in healthy American Indian infants for two rotavirus seasons .
METHODS	Infants aged @ to @ weeks were enrolled in a randomized , double-blind efficacy study .
METHODS	Infants were orally administered RRV-TV ( @ x @ ( @ ) plaque-forming units per dose ) , RRV-S@ ( @ x @ ( @ ) plaque-forming units per dose ) , or placebo at @ , @ , and @ months of age .
METHODS	Stools collected during episodes of gastroenteritis were tested for detection of rotavirus antigen .
METHODS	A total of @ infants received at least one dose of a study vaccine or placebo , and @ received all three doses according to the protocol .
RESULTS	During the first year of surveillance , the estimates of vaccine efficacy ( with @ % confidence interval ) for preventing rotaviral gastroenteritis were @ % ( @ , @ ) for RRV-TV and @ % ( -@ , @ ) for RRV-S@ .
RESULTS	In this population only @ % of rotaviral gastroenteritis episodes among placebo recipients were associated with type G@ disease .
RESULTS	For severe disease the estimates of vaccine efficacy were higher : @ % ( @ , @ ) for RRV-TV and @ % ( -@ , @ ) for RRV-S@ .
CONCLUSIONS	These data indicate that RRV-TV is moderately efficacious in preventing all episodes of gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus and is most efficacious against the severe disease characteristic of rotaviral illness .

BACKGROUND	An easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy is needed to prevent anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery .
BACKGROUND	This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cyanoacrylate surgical sealant in establishing hemostasis of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene to arterial vascular anastomoses in arteriovenous ( AV ) grafts and femoral bypass grafts .
METHODS	This multicenter , randomized , controlled , open-label study was conducted in a hospital setting at @ sites : @ in the United States and @ in Europe .
METHODS	A total of @ patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures or AV shunt procedures for hemodialysis access using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were randomized @:@ to receive cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control ( oxidized cellulose ) between April @ , @ , and January @ , @ .
METHODS	Randomization was stratified by clinical site and type of procedure .
METHODS	After the anastomosis , cyanoacrylate surgical sealant or the control was applied to all anastomosis sites for patients undergoing femoral bypass procedures and to only the arterial anastomosis sites for patients undergoing AV shunt procedures .
METHODS	The primary end point was the elapsed time from clamp release to hemostasis .
METHODS	Secondary end points were the proportion of patients achieving hemostasis at t = @ ( immediate ) , @ , @ , or @ minutes after clamp release , use of additional adjunctive measures to achieve hemostasis , and occurrence of adverse events .
RESULTS	Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics showed that the two treatment groups were similar at baseline .
RESULTS	The mean time from clamp release to hemostasis was @ seconds with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant vs @ seconds with the control ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Immediate hemostasis was achieved in @ % of patients receiving cyanoacrylate surgical sealant and in @ % of those receiving the control .
RESULTS	The proportion of patients requiring additional adjunctive measures was lower with cyanoacrylate surgical sealant , and the occurrence of adverse events was similar in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	This study demonstrates that cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is effective at reducing the time to hemostasis and achieving immediate hemostasis in AV shunt and femoral bypass procedures and that it is safe for internal use .
CONCLUSIONS	Cyanoacrylate surgical sealant is an easy-to-use vascular sealant with good safety and efficacy that significantly decreases anastomotic bleeding in vascular surgery .

BACKGROUND	Former sleep studies among non-treatment seeking chronic cocaine users had captured polysomnographic changes for as long as three weeks of abstinence .
METHODS	@ cocaine dependent participants , randomized to placebo in an ongoing clinical trial , received @ days of inpatient substance abuse treatment followed by @ weeks of outpatient cognitive behavioral therapy .
METHODS	Polysomnographic recording was performed on consecutive nights during the @st and @nd inpatient and @rd and @th outpatient weeks .
METHODS	Number of days abstinent was determined from thrice weekly urine toxicology and self-report .
METHODS	Polysomnographic sleep was compared between study week @ and @ , using paired t-tests .
METHODS	Trajectory of total sleep time ( TST ) was modeled both as a linear and a quadratic function of days abstinent .
RESULTS	Despite reporting an improvement in overall sleep quality , polysomnographic sleep worsened from week @ to @ .
RESULTS	Among all participants , TST and stage @ sleep time decreased , while REM sleep latency increased .
RESULTS	Among participants who began the study with a positive urine test , there was also a decrease in REM and a trend for decreased slow wave sleep .
RESULTS	TST compared to number of days abstinent ( up to @ days ) was best fit with a quadratic model ( p = @ ) , suggesting the possibility of an improvement in total sleep time with extended abstinence .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first polysomnographic characterization of sleep in a large sample of cocaine users in treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Present findings confirm earlier results of poor and deteriorating sleep early in abstinence , and raise the possibility of improvement after an extended abstinence .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and other metabolic effects of plant sterol and stanol esters , both of which are commonly used in the dietary management of hypercholesterolaemia .
RESULTS	The cholesterol-lowering efficacy of equivalent intakes of sterol and stanol esters and of different intakes of stanol esters were compared at @ and @ months , both in normal subjects and treated patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia .
RESULTS	Systemic effects were assessed by measuring serum levels of plant sterols and of lathosterol and @alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone , indices of sterol absorption and of cholesterol and bile acid synthesis respectively .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences during the study between @ g daily of sterol and stanol esters in reducing total cholesterol ( by @-@ % ) or low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( by @-@ % ) , nor between @ and @ g daily of stanol .
RESULTS	However , the cholesterol-lowering effect of plant sterol esters was attenuated between @ and @ months .
RESULTS	This was accompanied by increased serum plant sterols and decreased levels of @alpha-hydroxy-cholestenone , especially in statin-treated hypercholesterolaemic patients not taking bile acid sequestrants .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that absorption of dietary plant sterols suppressed bile acid synthesis , thereby diminishing their cholesterol-lowering efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , plant stanols reduced plant sterol absorption and maintained their cholesterol-lowering efficacy .

METHODS	Although generalized convulsive status epilepticus is a life-threatening emergency , the best initial drug treatment is uncertain .
METHODS	We conducted a five-year randomized , double-blind , multicenter trial of four intravenous regimens : diazepam ( @ mg per kilogram of body weight ) followed by phenytoin ( @ mg per kilogram ) , lorazepam ( @ mg per kilogram ) , phenobarbital ( @ mg per kilogram ) , and phenytoin ( @ mg per kilogram ) .
METHODS	Patients were classified as having either overt generalized status epilepticus ( defined as easily visible generalized convulsions ) or subtle status epilepticus ( indicated by coma and ictal discharges on the electroencephalogram , with or without subtle convulsive movements such as rhythmic muscle twitches or tonic eye deviation ) .
METHODS	Treatment was considered successful when all motor and electroencephalographic seizure activity ceased within @ minutes after the beginning of the drug infusion and there was no return of seizure activity during the next @ minutes .
METHODS	Analyses were performed with data on only the @ patients with verified generalized convulsive status epilepticus as well as with data on all @ patients who were enrolled .
RESULTS	Three hundred eighty-four patients had a verified diagnosis of overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus .
RESULTS	In this group , lorazepam was successful in @ percent of those assigned to receive it , phenobarbital in @ percent , diazepam plus phenytoin in @ percent , and phenytoin in @ percent ( P = @ for the overall comparison among the four groups ) .
RESULTS	Lorazepam was significantly superior to phenytoin in a pairwise comparison ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among the @ patients with a verified diagnosis of subtle generalized convulsive status epilepticus , no significant differences among the treatments were detected ( range of success rates , @ to @ percent ) .
RESULTS	In an intention-to-treat analysis , the differences among treatment groups were not significant , either among the patients with overt status epilepticus ( P = @ ) or among those with subtle status epilepticus ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences among the treatments with respect to recurrence during the @-hour study period , the incidence of adverse reactions , or the outcome at @ days .
CONCLUSIONS	As initial intravenous treatment for overt generalized convulsive status epilepticus , lorazepam is more effective than phenytoin .
CONCLUSIONS	Although lorazepam is no more efficacious than phenobarbital or diazepam plus phenytoin , it is easier to use .

OBJECTIVE	To assess whether `` phasic '' exercises , including rapid eye-head-neck-arm movements , can benefit patients with chronic cervical injuries .
METHODS	A randomized , controlled , double blind study involving @ chronic patients , who were allocated to either group @ or group @ .
METHODS	The study period was for @ wk .
METHODS	The study was conducted in a private practice .
METHODS	Thirty chronic motor vehicle accident patients who continued to experience increased pain/soreness/stiffness of the cervical musculature with sports/activities requiring rapid head neck movements were selected for the study .
METHODS	Group @ patients ( n = @ ) had standard exercises ( stretching/isometric/isokinetic ) and chiropractic therapy .
METHODS	Group @ patients ( n = @ ) had `` phasic '' exercises and chiropractic therapy .
METHODS	Patients in both groups exercised for a minimum of four times weekly , for @ wk .
METHODS	Pre and Post Pain and Disability Index was administered to both groups .
RESULTS	Group @ , which had standard exercises and chiropractic therapy , improved by @ % ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Group @ , which had `` phasic '' exercises and chiropractic therapy , improved by @ % ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Confounders were identified , which explains the minimal improvement of group @ and the remarkable results of group @ .
CONCLUSIONS	It would appear that any rehabilitation program for chronic neck-injured patients should involve exercises that address the following : eye-head-neck-arm coordinated movements , coordination of the entire vertebral column , / and return the `` phasic '' component of the musculature to functional levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional studies will address the effect of these exercises on the strength , range of motion and pain improvement of the cervical spine in normal , acute and chronic patients .

OBJECTIVE	The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the number of sites of spinal dysfunction and a range of measures of cognitive processing .
METHODS	This double-blind , randomized , observational pilot study was performed at a chiropractic college clinical training facility .
METHODS	Thirty volunteers with clinical evidence of cervical spinal joint dysfunction participated .
METHODS	Subjects were classified into @ groups depending on whether they exhibited signs of cervical spinal joint dysfunction at one or more sites .
METHODS	A range of computer-based tasks was used to determine simple reaction time ( RT ) , choice RT , probe RT , and inhibition of a preplanned response .
RESULTS	Multiple sites of cervical spinal joint dysfunction were related to impaired cortical processing as revealed by significantly higher loads on central capacity , significantly less accurate response selection , and a trend toward more variable performance of an anticipated response .
RESULTS	Multiple sites of cervical spinal joint dysfunction do not appear to be related to the speed of response selection or the ability to inhibit a preplanned response .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study provides a context for the improvements in cortical processing observed after cervical spine adjustment .
CONCLUSIONS	It shows that probe RT may be a useful tool in further studies examining the effects of cervical spine manipulation of joint dysfunction and the associated effect on cognitive function .

BACKGROUND	Contrast echocardiography may be used to assess myocardial perfusion .
BACKGROUND	However , gray scale assessment of myocardial contrast echocardiography ( MCE ) is difficult because of variations in regional backscatter intensity , difficulties in distinguishing varying shades of gray , and artifacts or attenuation .
BACKGROUND	We sought to determine whether the assessment of rest myocardial perfusion by MCE could be improved with subtraction and color coding .
RESULTS	MCE was performed in @ patients with previous myocardial infarction with a @nd generation agent ( NC@ , Nycomed AS ) , using harmonic triggered or continuous imaging and gain settings were kept constant throughout the study .
RESULTS	Digitized images were post processed by subtraction of baseline from contrast data and colorized to reflect the intensity of myocardial contrast .
RESULTS	Gray scale MCE alone , MCE images combined with baseline and subtracted colorized images were scored independently using a @ segment model .
RESULTS	The presence and severity of myocardial contrast abnormalities were compared with perfusion defined by rest MIBI-SPECT .
RESULTS	Segments that were not visualized by continuous ( @ % ) or triggered imaging ( @ % ) after color processing were excluded from further analysis .
RESULTS	The specificity of gray scale MCE alone ( @ % ) or MCE combined with baseline @D ( @ % ) was significantly enhanced by subtraction and color coding ( @ % , p < @ ) of triggered images .
RESULTS	The accuracy of the gray scale approaches ( respectively @ % and @ % ) was increased to @ % ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , for continuous images , the specificity of gray scale MCE with and without baseline comparison was @ % and @ % respectively , compared with @ % after post processing ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The accuracy of colorized images ( @ % ) was also significantly greater than gray scale MCE ( @ % and @ % , p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The sensitivity of MCE for both acquisitions was not altered by subtraction .
CONCLUSIONS	Post-processing with subtraction and color coding significantly improves the accuracy and specificity of MCE for detection of perfusion defects .

OBJECTIVE	The incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is increasing , and the thrombin inhibitor danaparoid could be a useful alternative .
OBJECTIVE	The objective of the present study was to compare danaparoid and heparin in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting .
METHODS	In a prospective , randomized , double-blind clinical trial comparing heparin ( bolus of @ mg/kg ) with danaparoid ( bolus of @ U/kg ) , @ patients underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with one of the study drugs .
METHODS	The amount of blood lost , the number of homologous blood products transfused , the troponin T levels , and the amount of anti-Xa activity were monitored .
RESULTS	Thirty-four patients underwent @ + / - @ bypasses with danaparoid , and @ patients underwent @ + / - @ grafts with heparin ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Postoperative blood losses averaged @ + / - @ mL in patients receiving danaparoid and @ + / - @ mL in patients receiving heparin ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of homologous blood products transfused averaged @ + / - @ units in patients receiving danaparoid and @ + / - @ units in patients receiving heparin ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number of patients requiring homologous blood transfusion was higher in patients receiving danaparoid ( @/@ [ @ % ] ) than in patients receiving heparin ( @/@ [ @ % ] , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum anti-Xa activity averaged @ + / - @ U/mL in patients receiving danaparoid and @ + / - @ U/mL in patients receiving heparin @ minutes after injection of the drugs ( P = @ ) and @ + / - @ and @ + / - @ U/mL , respectively , @ hours after coronary artery bypass grafting ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Troponin serum levels were similar @ hours after coronary artery bypass grafting ( @ + / - @ and @ + / - @ microg/L , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with danaparoid versus heparin increases the number of patients exposed to homologous blood transfusion ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence limits , @-@ ) , off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting with danaparoid is a valuable alternative to heparin in patients with thrombocytopenia requiring surgical intervention .

METHODS	Dietary lipids are considered to be primary potentiators of carotenoid absorption , yet the amount and source required to optimize bioavailability has not been systematically evaluated .
METHODS	The objective of this study was to examine the impact of both amount and source of triacylglycerols on postprandial absorption of carotenoids from vegetable salads .
RESULTS	Healthy subjects ( n = @ ) were randomized using a Latin square design ( @ @ ) and consumed three identical salads with @ , @ , or @ g of canola oil , soybean oil , or butter .
RESULTS	Blood was collected from @-@ h and triacylglycerol-rich fractions ( TRLs ) were isolated by ultracentrifugation .
RESULTS	Carotenoid contents of TRL fractions were analyzed by HPLC-DAD .
RESULTS	Considering all lipid sources , @ g of lipid promoted higher absorption compared to @ and @ g for all carotenoid species ( p < @ ) , except for - carotene ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The source of lipid had less impact on the absorption of carotenoids than amount of lipid .
RESULTS	Pooling results from all lipid amounts , monounsaturated fatty acid rich canola oil trended toward enhancing absorption of lutein and - carotene compared to saturated fatty acid rich butter ( p = @ and p = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While both amount and source of co-consumed lipid affect carotenoid bioavailability from vegetables , amount appears to exert a stronger effect .

OBJECTIVE	Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is complicated by cytokine-driven alterations in protein and energy metabolism and consequent muscle wasting ( cachexia ) .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of a mixture of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate , glutamine and arginine ( HMB/GLN/ARG ) as nutritional treatment for rheumatoid cachexia .
METHODS	Forty RA patients supplemented their diet with either HMB/GLN/ARG or a nitrogen ( @ g/day ) and calorie ( @ kcal/day ) balanced mixture of alanine , glutamic acid , glycine , and serine ( placebo ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Body composition and other outcomes were assessed at baseline and follow-up , and analysed by mixed ANOVA .
RESULTS	Dietary supplementation with HMB/GLN/ARG was not superior to placebo in the treatment of rheumatoid cachexia ( groupxtime interactions P > @ for all outcomes ) .
RESULTS	Both amino acid mixtures significantly increased ( main effect of time ) fat-free mass ( @ + / -@ g , P < @ ) , total body protein ( @ + / -@ g , P = @ ) , arms ( @ + / -@ g , P < @ ) and legs ( @ + / -@ g , P < @ ) lean mass , and some measures of physical function .
RESULTS	No significant adverse event occurred during the study , but patients in the HMB/GLN/ARG group reported fewer gastrointestinal complaints compared to placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Dietary supplementation with HMB/GLN/ARG is better tolerated but not more effective in reversing cachexia in RA patients compared to the mixture of other non-essential amino acids used as placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Further controlled studies are necessary to confirm the beneficial anabolic and functional effects of increased nitrogen intake in this population .

BACKGROUND	It is not uncommon for patients with ischemic stroke to have peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) .
BACKGROUND	Patients with polyvascular diseases carry greater burden of atherosclerosis and higher risks of developing vascular events and death .
BACKGROUND	More effective regimens , such as dual antiplatelet agents , may be more effective for controlling progression of atherosclerosis in secondary prevention .
OBJECTIVE	This study aims to evaluate whether cilostazol plus aspirin is more efficacious than aspirin alone for preventing progression of atherosclerosis in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) who also have peripheral arterial disease .
METHODS	The Safety and Efficacy of Cilostazol in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Peripheral Arterial Disease ( SPAD ) study is a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Patients with previous ischemic stroke or TIA who had been taking aspirin ( @mg per day ) , aged @ years or older , with PAD in the lower limbs based on ankle-brachial index ( ABI ) < @ will be randomized into the treatment group with cilostazol ( @mg/day ) or the placebo group on @:@ basis .
RESULTS	Patients will be evaluated at @ , @ , @ , @ and @ months after randomization .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint is difference in change in ABI between groups .
RESULTS	The secondary and tertiary endpoints are the difference between groups in change in carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) and incidence rate of major cardiovascular events , including recurrent stroke , myocardial infarction , unstable angina , other vascular events , and death ; and the safety measures , including major bleeding events , hemorrhagic stroke and death of any cause .
CONCLUSIONS	The SPAD trial is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet agents , aspirin plus cilostazol , in comparison with aspirin alone in patients with both ischemic stroke or TIA and PAD .
CONCLUSIONS	Results from this trial will provide important information on the merit of adding cilostazol to aspirin for slowing down progression of atherosclerosis in patients with ischemic stroke and PAD .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the pharmacodynamic profile and duration of action for five subcutaneous doses of insulin detemir ( @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ units/kg ; @ unit = @ nmol ) and one subcutaneous dose of NPH insulin ( @ IU/kg ; @ IU = @ nmol ) .
METHODS	This single-center , randomized , double-blind , six-period , crossover study was carried out as a @-h isoglycemic clamp ( @ mmol/l ) in @ type @ diabetic patients .
RESULTS	Duration of action for insulin detemir was dose dependent and varied from @ , to @ , to @ , to @ , to @ h for @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ units/kg , respectively .
RESULTS	Interpolation of the dose-response relationships for AUC ( GIR ) ( area under the glucose infusion rate curve ) revealed that a detemir dose of @ units/kg would provide the same effect as @ IU/kg NPH but has a longer duration of action ( @ vs. @ h , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Lower between-subject variability was observed for insulin detemir on duration of action ( @ units/kg insulin detemir vs. @ IU/kg NPH , P < @ ) and GIR ( max ) ( maximal glucose infusion rate ) ( @ and @ units/kg insulin detemir vs. @ IU/kg NPH , both P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Assessment of endogenous glucose production ( EGP ) and peripheral glucose uptake ( PGU ) resulted in an AOC ( EGP ) ( area over the EGP curve ) of @ mg/kg ( @ % CI @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) and an AUC ( PGU ) ( area under the PGU curve ) of @ ( @-@ ) vs. @ ( @-@ ) for @ units/kg detemir vs. @ IU/kg NPH , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	This study shows that insulin detemir provides a flat and protracted pharmacodynamic profile .

BACKGROUND	This study aims at investigating the effect of a single pre-operative oral administration of morphine sulphate ( Oramorph ) on pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) .
METHODS	Forty-one ASA I-III patients , aged @-@ years , undergoing LC were randomly , double-blindly allocated to treatment ( N. = @ , @mg Oramorph , group M ) or placebo ( N. = @ , group P ) .
METHODS	General anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil .
METHODS	All patients received ketamine @ mg/kg iv at induction , intraoperative ketorolac @mg iv and tramadol postoperatively ( iv PCA : bolus @ mg , lock-out @ min , max @ mg/@ hours ) .
METHODS	Numerical rating scale for pain ( NRS ) , White 's fast track and PADSS scores , tramadol consumption and adverse events were recorded for the first @h .
METHODS	All patients underwent State Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) and Mini Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) .
RESULTS	Anthropometric characteristics , MMSE , STAI , ASA status , NRS rest , White 's and PADDS scores , PONV incidence were similar .
RESULTS	Group M showed significantly lower NRS on movement during the first @ hours after awakening .
RESULTS	Cumulative tramadol consumption was lower in group M than in group P ( @ mg versus @ mg , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Within a multimodal approach , a single preoperative oral administration of @ mg of morphine sulphate in patients undergoing LC did not improve pain at rest , but improved NRS on movement during the first @ hours after awakening .
CONCLUSIONS	Group P required a higher mean dose of tramadol compared to Group M , although not significantly .
CONCLUSIONS	The safety profile of Oramorph allowed fast extubation and awakening times as well as prompt home discharge within @ hours from surgery .

BACKGROUND	Palliative care incorporates comprehensive support of family caregivers because many of them experience burden and distress .
BACKGROUND	However , evidence-based support initiatives are few .
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated a one-to-one psychoeducational intervention aimed at mitigating the distress of caregivers of patients with advanced cancer receiving home-based palliative care .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that caregivers would report decreased distress as assessed by the General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ ) .
METHODS	A randomised controlled trial comparing two versions of the delivery of the intervention ( one face-to-face home visit plus telephone calls versus two visits ) plus standard care to a control group ( standard care only ) across four sites in Australia .
RESULTS	Recruitment to the one visit condition was @ , the two visit condition @ , and the control @ .
RESULTS	We previously reported non-significant changes in distress between times @ ( baseline ) and @ ( @-week post-intervention ) but significant gains in competence and preparedness .
RESULTS	We report here changes in distress between times @ and @ ( @-week post-death ) .
RESULTS	There was significantly less worsening in distress between times @ and @ in the one visit intervention group than in the control group ; however , no significant difference was found between the two visit intervention and the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	These results are consistent with the aim of the intervention , and they support existing evidence demonstrating that relatively short psychoeducational interventions can help family caregivers who are supporting a dying relative .
CONCLUSIONS	The sustained benefit during the bereavement period may also have positive resource implications , which should be the subject of future inquiry .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effect of isometric handgrip training on blood pressure ( BP ) in middle-aged women ( @ @ years ) .
METHODS	Isometric handgrip training was performed over five consecutive days .
METHODS	In each session , the treatment group ( n = @ ) performed four isometric contractions of @ seconds each at @ % of their maximal grip strength .
METHODS	The control group ( n = @ ) sat for @ minutes without exercising , for five consecutive days .
METHODS	Resting systolic ( SBP ) and diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) were measured pre - and post-intervention .
METHODS	Data were analysed using a two-factor ANOVA ( p @ ) .
RESULTS	Blood pressure readings were reduced in both groups ( SBP : p = @ ; DBP : p = @ ) , however there was no interaction effect for SBP or DBP .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings suggest that @ minutes of sitting per day for five consecutive days is just as effective as isometric handgrip training for reducing BP levels .
CONCLUSIONS	Future research is required to investigate the optimal isometric handgrip training stimulus required to reduce resting BP levels .

BACKGROUND	This study compared clinical and radiographic findings for the treatment of Class II furcation defects in human mandibular molars using anorganic bovine-derived hydroxyapatite matrix ( ABM ) / cell-binding peptide ( P-@ ) or open flap debridement ( OFD ) .
METHODS	Twelve subjects showing two comparable Class II furcation defects in their mandibular molars were enrolled .
METHODS	The defects in each subject were assigned randomly to the test ( ABM/P -@ ) or the control ( OFD ) group .
METHODS	Clinical measurements and standardized radiographs were taken at baseline and @ to @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant differences between the test and control groups for any clinical or radiographic parameter ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	On comparing the baseline and final measurements , the gain in horizontal clinical attachment level and reduction in gingival recession were significant only in the test group ( P < or = @ ) , whereas the gain in the vertical clinical attachment level was significant in both groups ( P < or = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the test group , four of @ sites showed complete closure , and five showed partial closure ; in the control group , three defects showed complete closure , and four showed partial closure ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Subtraction radiography revealed similar gains in bone height and increases in mean bone density with both treatments ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	ABM/P -@ yielded favorable results in the treatment of Class II furcation defects over a @-month evaluation period ; however , there was no difference compared to OFD .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies using a larger sample size are needed to confirm the present findings .

OBJECTIVE	To examine mortality and morbidity after prostate biopsy in the intervention arm of the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening ( PLCO ) trial .
METHODS	Abstractors from the PLCO trial recorded the types and dates of diagnostic follow-up procedures after positive screens and documented the types and dates of resultant complications .
METHODS	Cancers and deaths among the participants were tracked .
METHODS	The mortality rate in the @-day period after prostate biopsy was compared with a control rate of deaths in the @-day period after a negative screen in men without biopsy .
METHODS	Multivariate analysis was performed to control for potential confounders , including age , comorbidities and smoking .
METHODS	Rates of any complication , infectious and non-infectious complications were computed among men with a negative biopsy .
METHODS	Multivariate analysis was used to examine the risk factors for complications .
RESULTS	Of the @,@ men enrolled in the PLCO trial ( intervention arm ) , @ had at least one biopsy after a positive screen and @,@ had a negative screen and no biopsy .
RESULTS	The @-day mortality rate after biopsy was @ ( per @ ) , compared with the control group rate of @ ; the multivariate relative risk was @ ( @ % CI : @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	Among @ negative biopsies , the rates ( per @ ) of any complication , infectious and non-infections complications were @ , @ and @ , respectively .
RESULTS	A history of prostate enlargement or inflammation was significantly associated with higher rates of both infectious ( odds ratio [ OR ] = @ ) and non-infectious ( OR = @ ) complications .
RESULTS	Black race was associated with a higher infectious complications rate ( OR = @ ) and repeat biopsy was associated with lower rates of non-infectious complications ( OR = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mortality rates were not found to be higher after prostate biopsy in the PLCO trial and complications were relatively infrequent , with several risk factors identified .

BACKGROUND	The changing scope of women 's roles in combat operations has led to growing interest in women 's deployment experiences and post-deployment adjustment .
OBJECTIVE	To quantify the gender-specific frequency of deployment stressors , including sexual and non-sexual harassment , lack of social support and combat exposure .
OBJECTIVE	To quantify gender-specific post-deployment mental health conditions and associations between deployment stressors and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , to inform the care of Veterans returning from the current conflicts .
METHODS	National mail survey of OEF/OIF Veterans randomly sampled within gender , with women oversampled .
METHODS	The community .
METHODS	In total , @,@ female and @,@ male Veterans from a roster of all Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) Veterans .
METHODS	Response rate was @ % .
METHODS	Deployment stressors ( including combat and harassment stress ) , PTSD , depression , anxiety and alcohol use , all measured via self-report .
RESULTS	Women were more likely to report sexual harassment ( OR = @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) but less likely to report combat ( OR = @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Women and men were equally likely to report symptoms consistent with probable PTSD ( OR = @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) and symptomatic anxiety ( OR = @ , @ @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	Women were more likely to report probable depression ( OR = @ , @ % CI : @ , @ ) and less likely to report problematic alcohol use ( OR = @ , @ @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	With a five-point change in harassment stress , adjusted odds ratios for PTSD were @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) for women and @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) for men .
RESULTS	The analogous associations between combat stress and PTSD were @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) and @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	Although there are important gender differences in deployment stressors-including women 's increased risk of interpersonal stressors-and post-deployment adjustment , there are also significant similarities .
CONCLUSIONS	The post-deployment adjustment of our nation 's growing population of female Veterans seems comparable to that of our nation 's male Veterans .

BACKGROUND	Allergy immunotherapy tablet ( AIT ) treatment might be a safe and convenient form of specific immunotherapy but it has not been investigated in North American children and adolescents .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of timothy grass AIT treatment in North American children/adolescents with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis ( ARC ) with or without asthma .
METHODS	Three hundred forty-five subjects ( @-@ years old ) were randomized to once-daily grass AIT treatment ( @,@ bioequivalent allergen units , @,@ standardized quality tablet , approximately @ g of Phl p @ ) or placebo approximately @ weeks before the @ grass pollen season ( GPS ) .
METHODS	Treatment continued through the GPS .
METHODS	Daily symptoms and allergy rescue medication use were recorded .
METHODS	The primary end point was the total combined score ( TCS ) of the daily symptom score ( DSS ) and daily medication score ( DMS ) for the entire GPS .
METHODS	DSS , DMS , Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score , and Phl p @-specific IgG@ and IgE-blocking factor levels were secondary end points .
METHODS	Safety was assessed through adverse events .
RESULTS	Eighty-nine percent of subjects were multisensitized .
RESULTS	TCS , DSS , DMS , and Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire score versus placebo improved @ % ( P = @ ) , @ % ( P = @ ) , @ % ( P = @ ) , and @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Phl p @-specific IgG@ and IgE-blocking factor levels were significantly higher at the peak and end of the GPS ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Treatment was well tolerated .
RESULTS	Adverse events were generally mild and transient .
RESULTS	Although no investigator-assessed systemic allergic reactions were reported , @ grass AIT-treated subject experienced an event indicating a systemic reaction ( lip angioedema , dysphagia , and cough ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of once-daily timothy grass AIT treatment effectively treats timothy grass ( cross-reactive with Festucoideae grasses ) pollen-induced ARC in North American children @ years and older .
CONCLUSIONS	Given its convenient administration , lack of dose build-up requirement , safety profile , and efficacy , AIT treatment might become an important addition to the North American ARC treatment armamentarium .

OBJECTIVE	We previously reported that cognitive function improves with thyroxine and that there is a circannual pattern to mood and human TSH during Antarctic residence .
OBJECTIVE	To extend these findings , we examined the effects of tyrosine and a combined levothyroxine/liothyronine supplement in euthyroid men and women who spent the austral summer ( n = @ ) and/or winter ( n = @ ) in Antarctica .
METHODS	Randomized , placebo-controlled , clinical trial .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to receive the following each day for @ + / - @ days in summer and/or @ + / - @ days in winter : ( @ ) @g tyrosine mixed in @g applesauce ; ( @ ) @ microg of levothyroxine and @ microg of liothyronine ( T@-T@ Supplement ) ; or ( @ ) placebo .
METHODS	Cognitive performance and mood were assessed using the Automatic Neuropsychological Assessment Metric - Isolated and Confined Environments .
RESULTS	With placebo in summer , mood did not change while TSH decreased by @ % ; in winter , there was a @ % degradation in mood ( p < @ ) and TSH increased by @ % .
RESULTS	With combined T@-T@ supplement , there was a @ % degradation in mood in summer compared with placebo ( p < @ ) and TSH decreased by @ % ; in winter there was a @ % degradation in mood while TSH was reduced by @ % ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Tyrosine use in summer was associated with no change in mood and a @ % decline in TSH , while in winter there was a @ % improvement in mood and TSH decreased by @ % along with a @ % increase in fT@ ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of tyrosine leads to a significant reduction in serum TSH and improvement in mood in winter compared with placebo , while the combined T@-T@ supplement leads to a worsening of mood in summer and no improvement in winter .
CONCLUSIONS	There appears to be a seasonal influence on the psychological response to interventions and the relationship to changes in TSH reductions .

OBJECTIVE	We wished to determine which long-acting local anesthetic would produce the least pain on injection for treatment of myofascial pain disorders .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the pain on intramuscular injection of bupivacaine , ropivacaine , bupivacaine with dexamethasone , ropivacaine with dexamethasone , and needle placement alone .
METHODS	Thirty volunteers received @ injections each : ( @ ) needle only , ( @ ) bupivacaine @ % , ( @ ) ropivacaine @ % , ( @ ) bupivacaine @ % with dexamethasone @ mg/mL , and ( @ ) ropivacaine @ % with dexamethasone @ mg/mL .
METHODS	The injections were made in the volunteers ' upper trapezius muscles ; there was a @-minute interval between injections .
METHODS	The sequence of injections was randomized by Latin square design .
METHODS	The intensity of pain was rated on a @ to @ cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) score .
METHODS	Neither the investigator nor the volunteer was aware of the nature of the injectate .
METHODS	The pH of the injected solutions was checked to determine if differences in the intensity of pain on injection were due to differences in the pH of the solutions .
RESULTS	The VAS pain scores were @ + / - @ for needle only , @ + / - @ for bupivacaine , @ + / - @ for ropivacaine , @ + / - @ for bupivacaine/dexamethasone , and @ + / - @ for ropivacaine/dexamethasone .
RESULTS	The pain on injection of ropivacaine was significantly less than the pain on injection of bupivacaine or bupivacaine/dexamethasone .
RESULTS	The pH values of the solutions were as follows : ( @ ) bupivacaine , @ ; ( @ ) ropivacaine , @ ; ( @ ) bupivacaine/dexamethasone , @ ; and ( @ ) ropivacaine/dexamethasone , @ .
CONCLUSIONS	The pain on intramuscular injection of bupivacaine is significantly more intense than with ropivacaine .
CONCLUSIONS	The difference in the intensity of the pain on injection between bupivacaine and ropivacaine does not appear to be related to differences in pH. The results of our study have implications on the choice of the local anesthetic used in trigger point injections .

OBJECTIVE	Clinical evaluation of computed tomography ( CT ) fluoroscopy and comparison with conventional CT guidance for monitoring of percutaneous pulmonary biopsy procedures .
METHODS	Twenty CT-guided pulmonary biopsy procedures were conducted .
METHODS	The interventions have prospectively been performed either with CT fluoroscopy or with conventional CT guidance .
METHODS	About @ kV and @ mA with a frame-rate of eight images per second were used for CT fluoroscopy .
METHODS	Number of pleural needle passages , procedure times , radiation doses and histologic results were analyzed separately for both methods .
RESULTS	Compared with conventional CT guidance , CT fluoroscopy was associated with less pleural needle passages ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ ; P = @ , t-test ) and procedure times were shorter than for conventional CT guidance ( @ + / -@ min vs. @ + / -@ min ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Analysis of estimated patient related radiation exposure and histologic outcome showed no significant difference between conventional and fluoroscopic CT-guided procedures ( P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	CT fluoroscopy facilitates guidance of percutaneous pulmonary biopsy procedures .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with conventional CT assistance , procedure times are decreased and less pleural needle passages are required .
CONCLUSIONS	While patient-related radiation exposure is similar , operator-related radiation exposure remains a disadvantage associated with CT fluoroscopy .

BACKGROUND	Although evidence for the efficacy of postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis is scarce , many patients routinely receive such treatment after major surgeries .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to compare the incidence of surgical-site infections with intraoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis alone versus intraoperative plus postoperative administration .
METHODS	We did a prospective , open-label , phase @ , randomised study at seven hospitals in Japan .
METHODS	Patients with gastric cancer that was potentially curable with a distal gastrectomy were randomly assigned ( @:@ ) to receive either intraoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis alone ( cefazolin @ g before the surgical incision and every @ h as intraoperative supplements ) or extended antimicrobial prophylaxis ( intraoperative administration plus cefazolin @ g once after closure and twice daily for @ postoperative days ) .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified using Pocock and Simon 's minimisation method for institution and American Society of Anesthesiologists scores , and Mersenne twister was used for random number generation .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was the incidence of surgical-site infections .
METHODS	We assessed non-inferiority of intraoperative therapy with a margin of @ % .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention-to-treat .
METHODS	During hospital stay , infection-control personnel assessed patients for infection , and the principal surgeons were required to check for surgical-site infections at outpatient clinics until @ days after surgery .
METHODS	This study is registered with UMIN-CTR , UMIN@ .
RESULTS	Between June @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive either intraoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis alone ( n = @ ) or extended antimicrobial prophylaxis ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Eight patients ( @ % , @ % CI @-@ % ) had surgical-site infections in the intraoperative group compared with @ ( @ % , @-@ ) in the extended group .
RESULTS	The relative risk of surgical-site infections with intraoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis was @ ( @-@ ) , which revealed statistically significant non-inferiority ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Elimination of postoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis did not increase the incidence of surgical-site infections after a gastrectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , this treatment is not recommended after gastric cancer surgery .

OBJECTIVE	We assessed myocardial salvage achieved by reperfusion with percutaneous coronary interventions ( PCI ) and compared stenting with balloon angioplasty ( PTCA ) in patients with acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ineligible for thrombolysis .
BACKGROUND	A substantial proportion of patients with AMI are currently considered ineligible for thrombolysis , and reperfusion treatment is frequently not recommended for them .
BACKGROUND	It is not known whether these patients benefit from PCI .
METHODS	The Stent or PTCA for Occluded Coronary Arteries in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction Ineligible for Thrombolysis ( STOPAMI-@ ) trial , a randomized , open-label study , included @ patients with AMI who were ineligible for thrombolysis ( lack of ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram , late presentation > @ h after symptom onset , and contraindications to thrombolysis ) .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to receive either coronary artery stenting ( n = @ ) or PTCA ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Scintigraphic myocardial salvage index ( proportion of the initial myocardial perfusion defect that was salvaged by reperfusion ) was the primary end point of the study .
RESULTS	A considerable myocardial salvage was achieved with both stenting and PTCA .
RESULTS	In patients assigned to receive stenting , the median size of the salvage index was @ ( @th and @th percentiles , @ and @ ) , as compared with a median of @ ( @th and @th percentiles , @ and @ ) in the group assigned to receive PTCA ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Mortality at six months was @ % in the group of patients assigned to receive stenting and @ % in the group of patients assigned to receive PTCA ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with AMI who are currently considered ineligible for thrombolysis by conventional guidelines may greatly benefit from primary PCI .
CONCLUSIONS	The benefit seems to be comparable when a strategy of stenting is compared with a strategy of PTCA in these patients .

BACKGROUND	Asthma exacerbations during pregnancy are common and can be associated with substantial maternal and fetal morbidity .
BACKGROUND	Treatment decisions based on sputum eosinophil counts reduce exacerbations in non-pregnant women with asthma , but results with the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ( F ( E ) NO ) to guide management are equivocal .
BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that a management algorithm for asthma in pregnancy based on F ( E ) NO and symptoms would reduce asthma exacerbations .
METHODS	We undertook a double-blind , parallel-group , controlled trial in two antenatal clinics in Australia .
METHODS	@ pregnant , non-smoking women with asthma were randomly assigned , by a computer-generated random number list , before @ weeks ' gestation to treatment adjustment at monthly visits by an algorithm using clinical symptoms ( control group ) or F ( E ) NO concentrations ( active intervention group ) used to uptitrate ( F ( E ) NO > @ ppb ) or downtitrate ( F ( E ) NO < @ ppb ) inhaled corticosteroid dose .
METHODS	Participants , caregivers , and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment .
METHODS	Longacting @ agonist and minimum dose inhaled corticosteroid were used to treat symptoms when F ( E ) NO was not increased .
METHODS	The primary outcome was total asthma exacerbations ( moderate and severe ) .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	This study is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry , number @ .
RESULTS	@ women were randomly assigned to the F ( E ) NO group ( @ completed ) and @ to the control group ( @ completed ) .
RESULTS	The exacerbation rate was lower in the F ( E ) NO group than in the control group ( @ vs @ exacerbations per pregnancy ; incidence rate ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The number needed to treat was @ .
RESULTS	In the F ( E ) NO group , quality of life was improved ( score on short form @ mental summary was @ [ @ % CI @-@ ] in F ( E ) NO group vs @ [ @-@ ] in control group ; p = @ ) and neonatal hospitalisations were reduced ( eight [ @ % ] vs @ [ @ % ] ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Asthma exacerbations during pregnancy can be significantly reduced with a validated F ( E ) NO-based treatment algorithm .

BACKGROUND	Deficiency of nitric oxide ( NO ) production has been implicated in the pathogenesis of increased pulse wave reflection associated with systolic hypertension .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the effects on systolic blood pressure ( BP ) and pulse wave contour of two nitrate donors , isosorbide mononitrate ( ISMN ) and L-arginine .
METHODS	The subjects were @ elderly patients chronically treated with antihypertensive agents .
METHODS	In seven of the subjects , agents causing angiotensin II ( AII ) inhibition ( angiotensin-converting enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitor or AT ( @ ) receptor antagonist , or both ) were used .
METHODS	Study entry required systolic BP of @ to @ mm Hg , and aortic pulse wave augmentation more than @ mm Hg .
METHODS	Pharmacodynamic responses to ISMN , L-arginine , and ISMN plus L-arginine , were assessed in double-blind crossover studies by standard sphygmomanometry and applanation tonometry .
RESULTS	Peripheral systolic BP , aortic systolic BP , and the aortic augmentation index were decreased ( P < @ ) by ISMN , irrespective of AII inhibition .
RESULTS	L-arginine enhanced these effects ( P < @ ) in the subjects without AII inhibition , but not in those receiving AII inhibitors .
RESULTS	Given without ISMN or AII inhibitors , L-arginine decreased peripheral systolic BP , but to a lesser extent than ISMN .
CONCLUSIONS	L-arginine has potential value as an adjunct to ISMN in combination with antihypertensive therapy in elderly patients with systolic hypertension .
CONCLUSIONS	However , when given with single-dose ISMN , its vasodilator activity may overlap with that of AII inhibitors .

BACKGROUND	In children , sevoflurane anaesthesia is associated with postanaesthetic agitation , which is treated mainly with opioids .
BACKGROUND	We compared the effectiveness of epidural and i.v. clonidine in the prevention of this postanaesthetic agitation .
METHODS	Eighty children aged @-@ yr ( ASA I-II ) received standardized general anaesthesia with inhaled sevoflurane and caudal epidural block with @ % bupivacaine @ ml kg-@ for minor surgery .
METHODS	The children were assigned randomly to four groups : ( I ) clonidine @ microgram kg-@ added to caudal bupivacaine ; ( II ) clonidine @ micrograms kg-@ added to caudal bupivacaine ; ( III ) clonidine @ micrograms kg-@ i.v. and caudal bupivacaine ; and ( IV ) caudal block with bupivacaine , no clonidine ( control ) .
METHODS	A blinded observer assessed the behaviour of the children during the first postoperative hour .
METHODS	Secondary end-points were the time to fitness for discharge from the postanaesthesia care unit , and haemodynamic and respiratory variables .
RESULTS	The incidence of agitation was @ , @ , @ and @ % in groups I , II , III and IV respectively ( P < @ for groups II and III compared with group IV ) .
RESULTS	During the first hour after surgery , patients in groups II and III had significantly lower scores for agitation than group IV patients .
RESULTS	Time to fitness for discharge did not differ between the four groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Clonidine @ micrograms kg-@ prevented agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia , independently of the route of administration .
CONCLUSIONS	The effect of clonidine appears to be dose-dependent , as an epidural dose of @ microgram kg-@ failed to reduce it .

BACKGROUND	Pain is among the most cited negative effects of orthodontic treatment .
BACKGROUND	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs seem to be an effective option for minimizing this but can have adverse effects on tooth movement owing to their ability to block prostaglandin synthesis .
BACKGROUND	Acetaminophen has been suggested as the analgesic of choice during orthodontic treatment as it showed no effect on orthodontic tooth movement in previous animal studies .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of ibuprofen and acetaminophen on the prostaglandin E@ ( PGE@ ) levels of the gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) during orthodontic tooth movement in human subjects .
METHODS	A total of @ patients ( mean age @ years ) were randomly divided into three equal groups : ibuprofen , acetaminophen , and control groups .
METHODS	Maxillary canines were distalized with @ g of force delivered by NiTi coil springs .
METHODS	GCF samples were obtained before ( baseline ) and after spring activation at @ , @ , and @ h.
METHODS	The PGE@ content of the GCF was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .
RESULTS	PGE@ levels in all groups increased significantly by @ and @ h of force application and decreased to baseline levels by @ h. No significant difference was found between the acetaminophen and control groups at any time point .
RESULTS	There was a significant decrease in PGE@ levels in the ibuprofen group at @ and @ h when compared to the other two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Acetaminophen showed no significant effect on prostaglandin synthesis and may be the safe choice compared to ibuprofen for relieving pain associated with orthodontic tooth movement .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to investigate whether omega-@ fatty acids ( n-@ FA ) reduce the occurrence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
BACKGROUND	Meta-analyses have shown significant reduction of restenosis after coronary angioplasty upon supplementation with n-@ FA .
METHODS	In a prospective , placebo-controlled , double-blind study , @ patients were randomly allocated to treatment with n-@ FA ( Omacor , Pronova AS , Oslo , Norway ) @ g/day or corn oil ( placebo ) starting at least two weeks prior to elective coronary angioplasty .
METHODS	The treatment was continued until restenosis evaluation by quantitative coronary angiography after six months .
METHODS	Stenosis was defined as a minimal luminal diameter ( MLD ) < @ % of the reference diameter .
METHODS	Successful coronary angioplasty was defined as > or = @ % acute gain in MLD and a residual stenosis < @ % .
METHODS	Restenosis was defined as > or = @ % late loss of diameter and stenosis > @ % or an increase in stenosis of > or = @ mm .
METHODS	Three-hundred ninety-two patients fulfilled the criteria for initial stenosis and successful coronary angioplasty , and , except four patients who died , none were lost for follow-up .
RESULTS	Restenosis occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) of the treated stenoses in the Omacor group and in @/@ ( @ % ) in the placebo group ( odds ratio [ OR ] @ , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] [ @-@ @ ] p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the Omacor group one or more restenoses occurred in @/@ ( @ % ) patients as compared with @/@ ( @ % ) in the placebo group ( OR @ , @ % CI [ @-@ @ ] p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Supplementation with @ g n-@ FA/day for six months , initiated at least two weeks prior to coronary angioplasty did not reduce the incidence of restenosis .

BACKGROUND	The lowering of cholesterol concentrations in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease improves outcome .
BACKGROUND	No study , however , has assessed benefits of cholesterol lowering in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in hypertensive patients who are not conventionally deemed dyslipidaemic .
METHODS	Of @ hypertensive patients ( aged @-@ years with at least three other cardiovascular risk factors ) randomised to one of two antihypertensive regimens in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial , @ with non-fasting total cholesterol concentrations @ mmol/L or less were randomly assigned additional atorvastatin @ mg or placebo .
METHODS	These patients formed the lipid-lowering arm of the study .
METHODS	We planned follow-up for an average of @ years , the primary endpoint being non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD .
METHODS	Data were analysed by intention to treat .
RESULTS	Treatment was stopped after a median follow-up of @ years .
RESULTS	By that time , @ primary events had occurred in the atorvastatin group compared with @ events in the placebo group ( hazard ratio @ [ @ % CI @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	This benefit emerged in the first year of follow-up .
RESULTS	There was no significant heterogeneity among prespecified subgroups .
RESULTS	Fatal and non-fatal stroke ( @ atorvastatin vs @ placebo , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) , total cardiovascular events ( @ vs @ , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) , and total coronary events ( @ vs @ , @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) were also significantly lowered .
RESULTS	There were @ deaths in the atorvastatin group and @ in the placebo group ( @ [ @-@ @ ] , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Atorvastatin lowered total serum cholesterol by about @ mmol/L compared with placebo at @ months , and by @ mmol/L after @ years of follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	The reductions in major cardiovascular events with atorvastatin are large , given the short follow-up time .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings may have implications for future lipid-lowering guidelines .

BACKGROUND	Management of lamivudine-resistant chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) remains challenging , as inappropriate choice of treatment may cause multidrug resistance .
BACKGROUND	Until now , randomized trials directly comparing adding adefovir and switching to entecavir monotherapy have not been reported .
OBJECTIVE	This multicentre prospective randomized study was designed to compare the efficacy of these two strategies .
METHODS	Two hundred and nineteen lamivudine-resistant CHB patients were randomized to either adefovir-lamivudine combination group or entecavir monotherapy group ( n = @ vs. @ ) , and followed up for @ months .
RESULTS	One hundred and eighty patients completed this study .
RESULTS	At month @ , virological response rate [ hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA < @ IU/ml ] was higher in the adefovir-lamivudine combination group compared with entecavir group ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) , although biochemical and serological response rates were not significantly different .
RESULTS	Genotypic resistance ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) and combined viral breakthrough ( @ % vs. @ % , P < @ ) were more frequent in the entecavir group .
RESULTS	However , by subgroup analysis , virological response rates were not significantly different between the two therapies in HBeAg-positive patients ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) or in patients with high baseline HBV DNA ( @ log IU/ml ) ( @ % vs. @ % , P = @ ) at month @ .
CONCLUSIONS	This study showed that adefovir-lamivudine combination provides significantly higher antiviral efficacy and the lower resistance rate compared with the entecavir monotherapy in the management of lamivudine-resistant CHB .
CONCLUSIONS	However , it had limited efficacy in HBeAg-positive patients or in patients with high baseline HBV DNA .

BACKGROUND	No prospective trial-based data are available for incremental cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents ( DES ) compared with bare-metal stents ( BMS ) in unselected patients , as treated in everyday practice .
METHODS	The Basel stent cost-effectiveness trial ( BASKET ) included @ consecutive patients treated with angioplasty and stenting for @ de-novo lesions , irrespective of indication for angioplasty .
METHODS	Patients were randomised to one of two DES ( Cypher , n = @ ; Taxus , n = @ ) or to a cobalt-chromium-based BMS ( Vision , n = @ ) and followed up for @ months for occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and costs .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention-to-treat .
METHODS	The primary endpoint was cost-effectiveness after @ months , with effectiveness defined as reduction of major adverse cardiac events .
RESULTS	Cardiac death , myocardial infarction , or target vessel revascularisation occurred in @ of @ ( @ % ) patients with DES and @ of @ ( @ % ) with BMS ( odds ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ @ ; p = @ ) , without significant differences between the two DES .
RESULTS	Total costs at @ months were higher with DES ( mean @,@ , SD @ ) than with BMS ( @ , @ ; p < @ ) ; higher stent costs of DES were not compensated for by lower follow-up costs .
RESULTS	Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DES compared with BMS to avoid one major event was @,@ , and costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were more than @ @ .
RESULTS	Subgroup analyses showed that DES were more cost-effective for elderly patients in specific high-risk groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In a real-world setting , use of DES in all patients is less cost effective than in studies with selected patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Use of these stents could be restricted to patients in high-risk groups .

BACKGROUND	In addition to their bronchodilating effect , long-acting inhaled beta-agonists have recently been shown to have some anti-inflammatory properties .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of formoterol on inflammatory mediators in children .
METHODS	In this double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled trial , @ children , aged @ to @ years , with moderate atopic asthma , were randomly allocated to receive formoterol or matching placebo for @ weeks .
METHODS	The primary endpoint of this study was to determine changes in serum levels of inflammatory markers after treatment with formoterol ; secondary endpoints included clinical efficacy and bronchial hyperreactivity .
METHODS	The following parameters were measured : symptom score , forced expiratory volume in @ second ( FEV@ ) , provocative concentration of histamine causing a @ % fall in FEV@ ( PC@ ) for histamine and peripheral blood eosinophil count , serum levels of eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) , soluble receptor of interleukin-@ ( sIL-@R ) , level of interleukin-@ ( IL-@ ) , level of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-@ ( ICAM-@ ) , and immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) level before and after treatment .
RESULTS	Compared with placebo , treatment with formoterol significantly improved lung function .
RESULTS	The mean value of FEV@ changed from @ % of predicted value before treatment to @ % of predicted value after treatment ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean concentration of eosinophil blood count before and after treatment was @ and @ cells/mm@ ( P = @ ) ; ECP was @ and @ mcg/L ; and serum IL-@ was @ and @ pg/mL ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference between formoterol and placebo recipients in PC@H , and serum concentration of sIL-@R , sICAM-@ , or IgE after treatment .
RESULTS	The group that received formoterol showed improvement in pulmonary function as measured by FEV@ ( P < @ ) , and PC@H ( P = @ ) after @ weeks of treatment .
RESULTS	These patients also showed improvement of clinical symptoms ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum marker measurements in the formoterol group showed decreased concentrations of eosinophil blood count , ECP , and IL-@ , but there was no difference in before and after measurements of sIL-@R , sICAM-@ , and IgE .

BACKGROUND	Low-carbohydrate , ketogenic diets ( LCKD ) are effective for weight loss , but concerns remain regarding cardiovascular risk .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an LCKD program on serum lipoprotein subclasses .
METHODS	This was a randomized , two-arm clinical trial in an outpatient research clinic involving overweight , hyperlipidemic community volunteers motivated to lose weight .
METHODS	Subjects were randomized to either an LCKD ( n = @ ) and nutritional supplementation ( including fish , borage and flaxseed oil ) , or a low-fat , reduced-calorie diet ( LFD , n = @ ) .
METHODS	The main outcomes were fasting serum lipoprotein subclasses determined by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis .
RESULTS	The mean age of subjects was @ years , the mean BMI was @ kg/m ( @ ) , and @ % were women .
RESULTS	Comparing baseline to @ months , the LCKD group had significant changes in large VLDL ( -@ % ) , medium VLDL ( -@ % ) , small VLDL ( -@ % ) , LDL particle size ( +@ % ) , large LDL ( +@ % ) , medium LDL ( -@ % ) , small LDL ( -@ % ) , HDL particle size ( +@ % ) , large HDL ( +@ % ) , and LDL particle concentration ( -@ % ) .
RESULTS	Compared with the LFD group , the LCKD group had greater reductions in medium VLDL ( p = @ ) , small VLDL ( p = @ ) and medium LDL ( p = @ ) , and greater increases in VLDL particle size ( p = @ ) , large LDL ( p = @ ) , and HDL particle size ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The LCKD with nutritional supplementation led to beneficial changes in serum lipid subclasses during weight loss .
CONCLUSIONS	While the LCKD did not lower total LDL cholesterol , it did result in a shift from small , dense LDL to large , buoyant LDL , which could lower cardiovascular disease risk .

OBJECTIVE	This study compares thermodilution cardiac output ( TD-CO ) and esophageal Doppler cardiac output ( ED-CO ) during periods of hemodynamic stability and after heart stabilization during off-pump coronary artery bypass ( OPCAB ) surgery .
METHODS	After Institutional Review Board approval , @ patients undergoing OPCAB had simultaneous comparison of TD-CO and ED-CO at three time periods .
METHODS	Measurements were recorded , in a blinded manner , after probe insertion ( T@ ) , immediately before and after ( T@ , T@ ) heart displacement and before starting any pharmacological treatment ( if needed ) to maintain systolic blood pressure to its value before heart mobilization .
METHODS	Measurements were also taken before sternal closure ( Tfinal ) .
RESULTS	Three hundred and two pairs of data were analyzed using the Bland and Altman method .
RESULTS	Bias , standard deviation ( SD ) of the bias ( precision ) , and degree of agreement ( bias + / - @ SD ) were calculated .
RESULTS	Based on published literature , we considered that the highest degree of agreement should be < @ L.min ( -@ ) to consider both methods as interchangeable .
RESULTS	At T@ , bias and SD of bias between TD-CO and ED-CO were -@ + / - @ L.min ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	Immediately before heart stabilization , bias + / - SD was @ + / - @ L.min ( -@ ) and after heart displacement , @ + / - @ L.min ( -@ ) .
RESULTS	At Tfinal , bias + / - SD was @ + / - @ L.min ( -@ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Because the degree of agreement was > @ L.min ( -@ ) at all measurement periods except T@ , we conclude that TD and ED are not interchangeable at any time during OPCAB surgery .

OBJECTIVE	To determine ( i ) the prevalence of impaired olfaction in a group of individuals post-laryngectomy , and ( ii ) whether intensive , clinician-supported training of the Nasal Airflow Inducing Manoeuvre ( NAIM ) was more effective at improving olfactory acuity than intensive , home practice over a @-week period .
METHODS	Cohort study followed by a randomised control trial of two treatments over a @-week period with a @-month review .
METHODS	Olfactory acuity was evaluated in @ laryngectomy patients .
METHODS	Results revealed @ % had impaired olfactory acuity ( anosmic or hyposmic ) .
METHODS	From this group @ eligible participants with reduced olfactory acuity were then randomly assigned into either the clinician-supported or home practice treatment group .
METHODS	Olfactory acuity and functional impact measures relating to olfactory acuity ( participation restriction , wellbeing/distress ) .
RESULTS	Although olfactory acuity significantly improved in both treatment groups following @ weeks of therapy , results indicated significantly greater improvement in the clinician-assisted group immediately post-treatment .
RESULTS	By @ months , post-treatment effects were maintained .
RESULTS	Both modes of treatment improved levels of patient wellbeing , however , only the clinician-assisted mode made a significant positive effect on levels of perceived participation restriction .
CONCLUSIONS	Reduced olfactory acuity is prevalent post-laryngectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Olfactory acuity can be significantly improved using either @ weeks of clinician-assisted or home practice using the NAIM manoeuvre , although the current data suggest that intensive clinician-assisted treatment can assist patients to improve more rapidly and have a positive impact on functional state .

OBJECTIVE	To study whether proactive educational counselling , in addition to routine clinical care , reduces psychological morbidity and improves quality of life and client satisfaction among women who suffer suboptimal outcomes during childbirth .
METHODS	A randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Obstetric unit of a tertiary teaching hospital .
METHODS	Women who had unexpected antenatal , intrapartum or postpartum events leading to suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy and childbirth .
METHODS	Educational counselling provided by a trained research nurse in the postnatal ward after delivery .
METHODS	Women in the control group received routine clinical care .
METHODS	The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale , the General Health Questionnaire and the Clinical Global Impression ( before and after counselling , at six weeks and six months post-delivery ) and the World Health Organisation Quality of Life scale ( WHO-QOL ) ( at six weeks and six months post-delivery ) .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in psychological morbidity , quality of life or client satisfaction between the counselling group and the control group .
RESULTS	Participants who underwent elective caesarean section and who had the educational counselling had significantly lower depression scores [ mean @ ( SD @ ) ] compared with those receiving routine care [ mean @ ( SD @ ) ] .
RESULTS	On the other hand , educational counselling may have deleterious effect to women 's quality of life in those who had instrumental delivery .
RESULTS	Participants allocated to the counselling group had a lower mean score @ ( SD @ ) in the physical domain of WHO-QOL than those in the intervention group @ ( SD @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Educational counselling , given on top of routine clinical care , does not give additional beneficial effects on the psychological wellbeing and quality of life of women who encountered suboptimal outcomes during pregnancy .

METHODS	A total of @ evaluable patients from @ centres in Spain , two in Poland and four in Germany were included in the trial .
METHODS	Side-effects and the scores of the EORTC QLQ-C@ and QLQ BR-@ questionnaires were compared in the three groups ( FAC , TAC pre-amendment and TAC post-amendment ) .
RESULTS	The addition of PPG to TAC significantly reduced the incidence of neutropenic fever , grade @-@ anaemia , asthenia , anorexia , nail disorders , stomatitis , myalgia and dysgeusia .
RESULTS	Patient QoL decreased during chemotherapy , more with TAC than FAC , but returned to baseline values afterwards .
RESULTS	The addition of PPG to TAC significantly reduced the percentage of patients with clinically relevant Global Health Status deterioration ( @ or more points over baseline value ) at the end of chemotherapy ( @ % versus @ % , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of PPG significantly reduces the incidence of neutropenic fever associated with TAC chemotherapy as well as that of some TAC-induced haematological and extrahaematological side-effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The HRQoL of patients treated with TAC is worse than that of those treated with FAC but improves with the addition of PPG , particularly in the final part of chemotherapy treatment .

BACKGROUND	: New olive oil-based ( OL ) lipid emulsions ( olive : soy oil = @:@ ) have lower polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) ( @ % vs @ % ) and higher vitamin E content ( an antioxidant ) compared with traditional soybean oil ( SO ) emulsions .
OBJECTIVE	: Compare efficacy and safety of OL with SO emulsions in preterm neonates ( < @ weeks ) at high risk for oxidative stress .
METHODS	: Preterm neonates ( gestation @ - < @ weeks ) were randomised to receive OL or SO emulsion for @ days using a standard protocol in a tertiary perinatal centre ( King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women , Perth , Western Australia ) .
METHODS	Investigators and outcome assessors were masked to allocation .
METHODS	Plasma F@-isoprostanes ( lipid peroxidation marker ) , plasma , and red blood cell fatty acids were measured before and after the study .
METHODS	Safety was monitored by liver function tests .
RESULTS	: Forty-four of @ participants ( OL-@ , SO-@ ) completed the study .
RESULTS	Both emulsions were well tolerated with no significant adverse events .
RESULTS	F@-isoprostane levels were comparable at baseline and study end .
RESULTS	Oleic and linoleic acid levels were significantly high on day @ in OL and SO groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Long-chain PUFA levels were similar between groups despite the lower PUFA content of OL .
RESULTS	The olive oil-based group had significantly higher levels of C@ :@ n-@ , suggesting Delta@-desaturase enzyme inhibition in the SO group .
CONCLUSIONS	: Olive oil-based emulsion was safe and well tolerated by preterm neonates .
CONCLUSIONS	Similar long-chain PUFA levels were achieved in the OL group despite significantly lower amount of PUFA content ; however , there was no difference in lipid peroxidation ( F@-isoprostane levels ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Large trials are needed to confirm these benefits .

OBJECTIVE	Our objective was to quantify the effects of intravenous anesthetics on values measured by or derived from transcranial Doppler sonography ( TCD ) during induction of general anesthesia .
METHODS	We recorded blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery ( V-MCA ) before , during , and after induction of general anesthesia in six groups of young patients without intracranial pathology ( n = @ each ) using TCD .
METHODS	Patients were randomized to receive either @ mg/kg propofol , @ mg/kg methohexital , @ mg/kg thiopental , @ mg/kg etomidate , @ micrograms/kg fentanyl and @ mg/kg midazolam , or @ mg/kg ketamine and @ mg/kg midazolam intravenously .
METHODS	At @ min after injection , each patient was intubated and given isoflurane @ % and nitrous oxide @ % in oxygen .
METHODS	Ventilation was set to achieve an end-tidal PCO@ of @ mm Hg .
METHODS	V-MCA , arterial blood pressure , heart rate , hematocrit , and PCO@ ( venous samples ) were measured before and @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ min after induction of anesthesia .
RESULTS	The preinduction data were not different between groups .
RESULTS	At @ min after injection , propofol , thiopental , methohexital , and etomidate significantly decreased V-MCA .
RESULTS	TCD values were only slightly affected following fentanyl/midazolam .
RESULTS	Ketamine/midazolam induced a modest rise in V-MCA .
RESULTS	After endotracheal intubation , V-MCA increased in all groups , and slowly declined thereafter .
CONCLUSIONS	Under the circumstances of our study , values derived from TCD measurements responded differently to the agents used to induce general anesthesia in nonneurosurgical patients .

BACKGROUND	Epidemiological studies have shown that increased arterial stiffness and wave reflections , major determinants of systolic and pulse pressure , are associated with morbidity and mortality .
BACKGROUND	Therapeutic trials based on cardiovascular mortality have recently shown that reduction of systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) requires normalization of both large-artery stiffness and wave reflections .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the antihypertensive effects of the very-low-dose combination of perindopril ( @ mg ) and indapamide ( @ mg ) ( one or two tablets per day ) with the beta-blocking agent atenolol ( @ mg ; one or two tablets per day ) in order to determine whether the combination decreased SBP and pulse pressure more than did atenolol , and whether this decrease occurred in relation to a reduction in arterial stiffness [ aortic pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) ] or a decrease in the intensity of , or delay in , wave reflections ( augmentation index , measured by applanation tonometry ) or a combination of both .
METHODS	This was a double-blind randomized study in @ individuals with essential hypertension followed for @ months .
METHODS	Arterial pressure was measured in the brachial artery ( mercury sphygmomanometer ) and in the carotid artery ( applanation tonometry ) .
RESULTS	For the same reduction in diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) , the combination of perindopril and indapamide decreased brachial SBP and pulse pressure significantly more than did atenolol ( adjusted differences between groups -@ + / - @ and -@ + / - @ mmHg , respectively ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	This difference was even more pronounced for the carotid than for the brachial artery .
RESULTS	Whereas both antihypertensive agents similarly decreased PWV , only the combination significantly attenuated wave reflections .
CONCLUSIONS	Normalization of SBP , pulse pressure and arterial function -- a haemodynamic profile known to improve survival significantly in hypertensive populations at high cardiovascular risk -- was achieved to a greater extent with a very-low-dose combination of perindopril and indapamide than with atenolol .

OBJECTIVE	We tested the hypothesis that LED phototherapy with combined @-nm and @-nm light will promote healing of venous ulcers that failed to respond to other forms of treatment .
BACKGROUND	A variety of dressings , growth factors , and adjunct therapies are used to treat venous ulcers , but none seems to yield satisfactory results .
METHODS	We used a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study to compare a total of @ patients divided with @ chronic ulcers into three groups .
METHODS	In group @ the ulcers were cleaned , dressed with @ % silver sulfadiazine ( SDZ ) cream , and treated with placebo phototherapy ( < @ J/cm ( -@ ) ) using a Dynatron Solaris @ phototherapy research device .
METHODS	In group @ the ulcers were treated similarly but received real phototherapy ( @ J/cm ( -@ ) ) instead of placebo .
METHODS	In group @ ( controls ) , the ulcers were simply cleaned and dressed with SDZ without phototherapy .
METHODS	The ulcers were evaluated with digital photography and computer image analysis over @ d or until full healing was attained .
RESULTS	Ulcers treated with phototherapy healed significantly faster than controls when compared at day @ ( p + / - @ ) , day @ ( p + / - @ ) , and day @ ( p + / - @ ) , and similarly healed faster than the placebo-treated ulcers at days @ and @ ( p + / - @ ) , but not at day @ .
RESULTS	The beneficial effect of phototherapy was more pronounced when the confounding effect of small-sized ulcers was removed from the analysis .
RESULTS	Medium - and large-sized ulcers healed significantly faster with treatment ( > or = @ % rate of healing per month ) than placebo or control ulcers ( p + / - @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Phototherapy promotes healing of chronic venous ulcers , particularly large recalcitrant ulcers that do not respond to conventional treatment .

OBJECTIVE	The research tested the accuracy of the VIVO Harvester software in identifying publications authored by faculty members affiliated with a National Institutes of Health Clinical and Translational Sciences Award ( CTSA ) site .
METHODS	Health sciences librarians created `` gold standard '' lists of references for the years @ to @ from PubMed for twenty-five randomly selected investigators from one CTSA site .
METHODS	These gold standard lists were compared to the same twenty-five investigators ' reference lists produced by VIVO Harvester .
METHODS	The authors subjected the discrepancies between the lists to sensitivity and specificity analyses .
RESULTS	The VIVO Harvester correctly identified only about @ % of the total eligible PubMed references for the years @-@ for the CTSA-affiliated investigators .
RESULTS	The identified references produced by VIVO Harvester were precise yet incomplete .
RESULTS	The sensitivity rate was @ , and the specificity rate was @ .
CONCLUSIONS	While the references produced by VIVO Harvester could be confirmed in PubMed , the VIVO Harvester retrieved only two-thirds of the required references from PubMed .
CONCLUSIONS	National Institutes of Health CTSA sites will need to supplement VIVO Harvester-produced references with the expert searching skills of health sciences librarians .
CONCLUSIONS	Health sciences librarians with searching skills need to alert their CTSA sites about these deficiencies and offer their skills to advance their sites ' missions .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to examine the relative effectiveness of @ forms of physical education instruction on students ' skill and technical performance , as well as content knowledge in @ track and field events .
METHODS	Students from @ classes in @ Portuguese schools completed @-min units conducted under the auspices of sport education or a more traditional teacher-directed format .
METHODS	Classes were randomly assigned to these conditions within each school .
RESULTS	Although both groups improved significantly from pretest to posttest , the sport education classes outperformed the traditional classes in both technique and skill execution .
RESULTS	Only the sport education group made significant improvements in content knowledge .
RESULTS	When the students in the traditional group were tested at the point in time where they would usually complete a unit of physical education ( @ min ) , there were no significant improvements in any of the study 's variables .
CONCLUSIONS	The explanation given for the superior performance outcomes of the sport education classes lies in the nature of formal competition and team affiliation , which are cornerstones of this pedagogical model .
CONCLUSIONS	That is , students take their learning experiences more seriously than in traditional and often inauthentic classes .
CONCLUSIONS	In terms of content knowledge , the fact that sport education has a level of content-embedded accountability that holds students accountable for their officiating duties is postulated as a significant contributor to their increased understanding of rules and protocols of athletic events .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate on bone density in women who have had a hysterectomy .
METHODS	Randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial of medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg , @ mg or placebo as an adjunct to oestrogen therapy .
METHODS	One hundred and twenty-three women , aged @ to @ years and currently receiving daily oestrogen , who presented at a university-based rheumatology practice .
METHODS	The women were randomly assigned to receive either medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg , @ mg or placebo daily beginning on day @ of each month for one year .
METHODS	Forty-one women were randomised into each group .
METHODS	The primary outcome measurement was the percentage of change from baseline in bone mineral density of the lumbar spine ( L@-L@ ) .
METHODS	Secondary outcome measures included differences in femoral neck bone density , cholesterol and triglyceride levels between groups .
RESULTS	At one year , change in bone mineral density did not differ between either the treatment or placebo groups .
RESULTS	Medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg and @ mg led to statistically significant reductions in very low density lipoprotein cholesterol , total triglycerides , and very low density lipoprotein triglycerides when compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg also led to a statistically significant reduction in high density lipoprotein cholesterol , high density lipoprotein-@ cholesterol , and high density lipoprotein-@ triglycerides .
CONCLUSIONS	Medroxyprogesterone acetate at either dose as an adjunct to oestrogen did not improve bone mineral density at one year when compared with placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	Medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg may not adversely affect lipids .
CONCLUSIONS	Medroxyprogesterone acetate @ mg , however , did reduce high density lipoprotein cholesterol and therefore may increase cardiovascular risk .

BACKGROUND	Melioidosis is a tropical infectious disease associated with significant mortality .
BACKGROUND	Most deaths occur early and are caused by fulminant sepsis .
METHODS	In this randomized , placebo-controlled trial , we assessed the efficacy of lenograstim ( granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [ G-CSF ] , @ mu g per day administered intravenously ) in ceftazidime-treated patients with severe sepsis caused by suspected melioidosis in Thailand .
RESULTS	Over a @-month period , @ patients were enrolled to receive either G-CSF ( @ patients , @ of whom had culture-confirmed melioidosis ) or placebo ( @ patients , @ of whom had culture-confirmed melioidosis ) .
RESULTS	Mortality rates were similar in both groups ( G-CSF group , @ % ; placebo group , @ % ; risk ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) , including among patients with confirmed melioidosis ( @ % vs. @ % ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The duration of survival was longer for patients who received G-CSF than for patients who received placebo ( @ h vs. @ h ; hazard ratio , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Receipt of G-CSF is associated with a longer duration of survival but is not associated with a mortality benefit in patients with severe sepsis who are suspected of having melioidosis in Thailand .
CONCLUSIONS	We hypothesize that G-CSF may `` buy time '' for severely septic patients , but survival is more likely to be improved by management of associated metabolic abnormalities and organ dysfunction associated with severe sepsis .

OBJECTIVE	Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is associated with worse outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .
OBJECTIVE	How CKD influences the benefit-risk balance of drug-eluting stents ( DES ) versus bare-metal stents ( BMS ) is less known .
RESULTS	In the multicentre BASKET-PROVE trial , @ patients in need of large coronary stenting ( @ mm ) were randomised @:@ to DES or BMS .
RESULTS	In an a priori planned secondary analysis , outcomes were evaluated according to renal function defined by estimated glomerular filtration rates ( eGFR ; normal : eGFR @ ml/min/@ @ m ( @ ) ; CKD : eGFR < @ ml/min/@ @ m ( @ ) ) .
RESULTS	The primary endpoint was the first major adverse cardiac event ( MACE : cardiac death , myocardial infarction , target vessel revascularisation ) up to @ years .
RESULTS	A Cox proportional-hazard model was used to evaluate adjusted relative risks ( hazard rates , HRs ) for BMS versus DES .
RESULTS	The interaction of stent type and renal function was tested .
RESULTS	CKD patients ( @ ( @ % ) / @ with such data ) had a @-year MACE rate of @ % versus @ % in those without CKD [ HR @ ( @-@ @ ) , p = @ ] with cardiac mortalities of @ % and @ % , respectively ( p = @ , non-significant after baseline adjustments ) .
RESULTS	The MACE rate was lower in CKD patients with DES than with BMS [ @ % versus @ % , p = @ , HR @ ( @-@ @ ) ] as was the MACE rate in patients without CKD [ @ % with DES versus @ % with BMS , p < @ , HR @ ( @-@ @ ) ] .
RESULTS	No significant interaction between stent type and renal function was found .
CONCLUSIONS	This analysis of patients needing large coronary artery stenting confirms the increased mortality of CKD patients and documents a long-term benefit of DES compared to BMS irrespective of kidney function .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies have given the caffeine in a variety of beverages or in capsules and it was of interest to see whether similar effects could be observed when the caffeine was given in gum .
BACKGROUND	In addition , chewing gum has been shown to have behavioural effects and the present study extended our knowledge of this topic .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the effects of caffeinated gum ( @ mg ) , placebo gum and no gum conditions on mood and attention .
METHODS	A double blind placebo controlled study was conducted with volunteers being randomly assigned to one of the three conditions .
METHODS	Baseline measures of mood and attention were taken prior to chewing and a test session was then conducted .
METHODS	One hundred and eighteen young adults participated in the study .
RESULTS	Caffeinated gum was associated with a more positive mood and better performance on tasks requiring sustained attention .
RESULTS	The caffeine improved the speed of encoding of new information which is consistent with previous findings .
RESULTS	Chewing placebo gum was also found to be associated with more positive mood , both shortly after chewing and at the end of the study .
CONCLUSIONS	The implications of the present study are that chewing caffeinated gum has been shown to improve performance efficiency and mood by its alerting and energising effects .
CONCLUSIONS	The profile of caffeine effects is what one would predict from the existing caffeine literature and such effects may be extremely beneficial in real-life situations .
CONCLUSIONS	Prior chewing of placebo gum was associated with a more positive mood and this also confirms previous findings .

BACKGROUND	The BELOB study , a randomised controlled phase @ trial comparing lomustine , bevacizumab and combined lomustine and bevacizumab in patients with recurrent glioblastoma , showed that the @-month overall survival rate was most promising in the combination arm .
BACKGROUND	Here we report the health-related quality of life ( HRQoL ) results , a secondary trial end-point .
METHODS	HRQoL was measured at baseline and every @weeks until progression using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) core questionnaire ( QLQ-C@ ) and brain module ( QLQ-BN@ ) .
METHODS	HRQoL was assessed over time for five preselected scales ( global health ( GH ) , physical ( PF ) and social functioning ( SF ) , motor dysfunction ( MD ) and communication deficit ( CD ) ) .
METHODS	Moreover , mean changes in HRQoL from baseline until progression were determined .
RESULTS	@/@ patients with at least a baseline HRQoL assessment were analysed .
RESULTS	Over time , HRQoL remained relatively stable in all treatment arms for all five scales , at least during the first three treatment cycles .
RESULTS	More than half ( @-@ % ) of the patients showed stable ( < @ point change ) or improved ( @ point change ) HRQoL during their progression-free time , except for SF ( @ % ) , irrespective of treatment arm .
RESULTS	Deterioration of mean HRQoL was most profound at disease progression for all scales except SF , which deteriorated earlier in disease course .
RESULTS	Compared to baseline , @ % of patients had clinically relevant ( @ points ) worse GH , PF and SF , while @ % and @ % had increased MD and CD at disease progression , irrespective of treatment arm .
CONCLUSIONS	Bevacizumab , whether or not in combination with lomustine , did not negatively affect HRQoL in patients treated for recurrent glioblastoma in this randomised study .

BACKGROUND	Familial hypercholesterolemia ( FH ) is associated with a high risk of coronary heart disease .
BACKGROUND	Pharmacological treatment and diet are both essential for the management of FH .
BACKGROUND	Foods rich in plant sterols ( PS ) may play an important role in the treatment of patients with these disorders .
OBJECTIVE	To test the effect of the intake of PS on low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) concentration , endothelial function ( EF ) and LDL particle size in @ patients with FH .
METHODS	Randomized and crossover dietary intervention study .
METHODS	Tertiary outpatient care .
METHODS	Thirty-eight were recruited , but only @ were subjected to four low-fat dietary intervention periods , each of @ weeks .
METHODS	Each intervention had a different content of cholesterol ( < @ or @ mg/day ) and sitosterol ( < @ or @ g/day ) .
METHODS	Lipid response , EF and LDL particle size were analysed after the intervention .
RESULTS	Plasma sitosterol/cholesterol ratio was higher during both plant sterol-rich periods than during the low plant sterols periods .
RESULTS	Basal sitosterol concentrations predicted the LDL-cholesterol response during the intake of plant sterol-enriched diets .
RESULTS	The change in LDL-cholesterol was significantly greater in subjects in the upper and intermediate tertiles of basal plasma sitosterol concentrations ( -@ + / -@ mg/dl , P = @ ; -@ + / -@ mg/dl , P = @ , respectively ) than in subjects in the lower tertile ( @ + / -@ mg/dl ) when they changed from a low cholesterol diet to a low cholesterol plus plant sterol diet .
CONCLUSIONS	Our study demonstrates that basal sitosterol values can predict hypolipidemic response in patients with FH .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the impact of testosterone supplementation on postprandial triglycerides in elderly men with subnormal endogenous testosterone .
METHODS	Twenty-six men with subnormal testosterone levels ( < or = @ nmol/L ) were randomly assigned to treatment with intramuscular testosterone or placebo for one year in a double-blinded study .
METHODS	The participants underwent an oral fat load before and after the treatment period , and serum and chylomicron triglyceride levels were measured fasting and @ , @ , @ and @ h afterwards , together with total fat mass and fat-free mass .
RESULTS	Total testosterone rose to low-normal levels in the testosterone-treated group .
RESULTS	No differences in waist circumference , body mass index , serum levels of total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high density lipoprotein cholesterol , fasting triglyceride concentrations or lipase activity between the groups were observed during testosterone treatment .
RESULTS	Testosterone treatment did not affect postprandial serum and chylomicron triglyceride levels assessed by area under the curve , incremental area under the curve or triglyceride response .
RESULTS	Total fat mass was significantly reduced ( p < @ ) while fat-free mass was significantly increased ( p < @ ) in the testosterone-treated group .
CONCLUSIONS	Normalizing testosterone levels in elderly men does not seem to affect the postprandial lipid metabolism to any great extent , but has favourable effects on body composition .

OBJECTIVE	The anatomical landmark for the anteroposterior ( AP ) axis of the proximal tibia and its variability was investigated in order to determine whether a certain landmark could be employed as a reference axis for the proximal tibia after the rotating platform mobile bearing and fixed bearing total knee arthroplasties ( TKAs ) .
METHODS	Eighty primary osteoarthritic knees were randomized to undergo either rotating platform mobile bearing ( Group A , n = @ ) or fixed bearing ( Group B , n = @ ) TKAs , and were followed up for @ and @ months , respectively .
METHODS	The AP axes were defined for the distal femur , proximal tibia , ankle , and each TKA component on the reconstructed CT scan and the angles between the distal femoral AP axis and those of each bone or component were estimated .
METHODS	Clinical and radiographic outcomes were evaluated during the follow up .
RESULTS	A significant difference was seen between the preoperative and postoperative rotational position of the proximal tibia relative to the distal femur following rotating platform mobile bearing TKA ( P = @ ) whereas no such difference was seen after fixed bearing TKA .
RESULTS	The mean postoperative alignment of the tibia differed between the two groups ( Group A : Group B = -@:@ , P = @ ) and its variability was significantly greater in group A ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	There were no differences in the clinical outcomes including range of motion , knee society score , function score , HSS , and WOMAC score as well as the mean postoperative coronal tibiofemoral alignment between the two groups .
CONCLUSIONS	The unpredictable change in the rotational axis of the tibia and its broad variability after rotating platform mobile bearing TKA may provide a warning against the use of a fixed landmark for establishing tibial rotational alignment .

BACKGROUND	Prewarming and intraoperative warming with forced air-warming systems prevent perioperative hypothermia and shivering in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery with epidural anesthesia .
BACKGROUND	We tested the hypothesis that intraoperative lower body forced air-warming prevents hypothermia in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia .
METHODS	Thirty healthy patients undergoing cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia were randomly assigned to forced air-warming or control groups ( identical cover applied with forced air-warming unit switched off ) .
METHODS	A blinded investigator assessed oral temperature , shivering , and thermal comfort scores at @-min intervals until discharge from the postanesthetic care unit .
METHODS	Umbilical cord blood gases and Apgar scores were also measured after delivery .
RESULTS	The maximum core temperature changes were similar in the two groups ( -@ degrees C + / - @ degrees C vs -@ degrees C + / - @ degrees C for the forced air-warming group and control group , respectively ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Core hypothermia ( < or = @ degrees C ) occurred in @ of @ patients receiving forced air-warming and in @ of @ unwarmed patients ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidence and severity of shivering did not significantly differ between groups .
RESULTS	Umbilical cord blood gases and Apgar scores were similar in both groups ( P = NS ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that intraoperative lower body forced air-warming does not prevent intraoperative hypothermia or shivering in women undergoing elective cesarean delivery with spinal anesthesia .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate the cause of visual acuity ( VA ) loss in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) receiving monthly ranibizumab injections in the pivotal ranibizumab phase III trials .
METHODS	Retrospective analysis .
METHODS	The Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab In the treatment of Neovascular AMD ( MARINA ) and Anti-VEGF Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD ( ANCHOR ) trials .
METHODS	Demographics and lesion characteristics at baseline and month @ were compared in patients with @ letters VA loss and patients with @ letters VA gain from baseline to month @ .
METHODS	Additional evaluations of fundus photographs from these patients were performed to assess features of non-exudative AMD , such as geographic atrophy ( GA ) and retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) abnormalities .
METHODS	Differences in lesion characteristics between patients who lost versus gained @ letters of VA from baseline to month @ .
RESULTS	At month @ , @ % of ranibizumab-treated patients from MARINA and @ % of ranibizumab-treated patients from ANCHOR had lost @ letters VA ; @ % of ranibizumab-treated patients from MARINA and @ % of ranibizumab-treated patients from ANCHOR had gained @ letters VA. .
RESULTS	Baseline characteristics associated with VA loss at month @ included older age , better VA , and larger lesions .
RESULTS	At month @ , an increased area of RPE abnormality was associated with VA loss in both the MARINA ( P = @ ) and ANCHOR ( P = @ ) trials .
RESULTS	Increased total lesion area at month @ was associated with VA loss in both trials .
RESULTS	In MARINA , the increase in total lesion area was attributable to an increase in the angiographic designation of atrophic scar among VA losers ( P = @ ) , but in ANCHOR it was attributable to an increased area of choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) ( P = @ ) but not an increased area of leakage ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Increased areas of GA , fibrosis , and hemorrhage were not associated with VA loss .
CONCLUSIONS	Vision loss after @ years of monthly ranibizumab therapy was associated with lesion characteristics commonly associated with suppressed CNV , such as pigmentary abnormalities , atrophic scar , and the absence of leakage .
CONCLUSIONS	Future VA improvements in patients receiving ranibizumab therapy may require preservation of photoreceptor and RPE function rather than strategies that target CNV .

BACKGROUND	Spectral entropy is an electroencephalogram-based monitoring technique with a frequency band enlarged to include the electromyogram spectrum , which is intended to help to assess analgesia .
BACKGROUND	Although its correlation with hypnosis has been shown , its performance during a noxious stimulation and the influence of neuromuscular blockade have not been described .
METHODS	In this prospective , open , multicenter study , @ patients received propofol then remifentanil target-controlled infusion for induction of anesthesia , with randomized remifentanil targets ranging from @ to @ ng/mL .
METHODS	Half of the patients received neuromuscular blockade .
METHODS	Intubation and incision were used as standard noxious stimulations , motor or hemodynamic responses were recorded , and spectral entropy values before and after stimulations were compared between responders and nonresponders .
RESULTS	No difference was found in response entropy ( RE ) , state entropy ( SE ) , or ( RE - SE ) between patients with or without hemodynamic response to stimulations .
RESULTS	Patients with motor response to intubation had higher values of RE , SE , and ( RE - SE ) both before and after the intubation than patients with no response .
RESULTS	These results were confirmed by a prediction probability analysis , showing a significant but weak predictive value of entropy for motor response only .
CONCLUSIONS	Entropy predicted a motor response to noxious stimulations but not a hemodynamic response , which limits its usefulness for assessing the analgesic component of anesthesia in paralyzed patients .
CONCLUSIONS	High values ( RE > @ ) before the stimulation should be avoided in order to decrease the risk of motor response , but lower values might not prevent this response when the opioid concentration is insufficient , despite an adequate hypnosis .

BACKGROUND	Growth hormone ( GH ) treatment in short children born small for gestational age ( SGA ) may result in metabolic changes with potential long-term effects .
METHODS	@ short SGA children ( mean birth weight @ @ kg , age @ @ years , height standard deviation score ( SDS ) -@ @ ) were randomised to : low-dose GH therapy ( @ mg/kg/day ) for @ years ; high-dose GH therapy ( @ mg/kg/day ) for @ year , or mid-dose GH therapy ( @ mg/kg/day ) for @ year .
METHODS	Leptin , ghrelin , insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) , IGF binding protein-@ ( IGFBP-@ ) , lipids , fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were assessed at baseline , @ and @ months .
RESULTS	After @ year of active treatment , GH significantly reduced serum ghrelin and increased IGF-I SDS and insulin levels .
RESULTS	Regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between ghrelin and IGF-I SDS ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Leptin and IGFBP-@ also declined ( both p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Changes in insulin levels reversed upon discontinuation .
RESULTS	Improvements in lipid profile were nonsignificant and fasting blood glucose levels remained within the normal range .
CONCLUSIONS	In short SGA children , ghrelin and leptin reductions associated with GH treatment may occur through a negative feedback loop of the GH-IGF-I axis .
CONCLUSIONS	Consequently , via ghrelin and leptin suppression , GH treatment may modify food intake and body composition and potentially improve long-term metabolic outcomes .

BACKGROUND	The importance of vitamin D on bone health and osteoporosis was studied by many researchers .
BACKGROUND	The main role of the Vitamin D is to absorb calcium and phosphate and increase bone mineralization .
BACKGROUND	Older people are at an increased risk of the inadequate vitamin D production in the skin because of lower sun exposure and reduced ability of the skin to synthesize vitamin D.
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of short-term ( @ weeks ) low energy UVB irradiation in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis using bone mineral density and bone turnover markers .
METHODS	A three-month , single-blinded , randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the University hospital in Daegu , Republic of Korea .
METHODS	Fifty-two postmenopausal Korean women ( older than @ years ) with osteoporosis were randomly allocated to have either low energy UVB or placebo for @ minutes a day for two weeks of treatment during winter .
METHODS	Laboratory analysis and physical examination before and @ , @ and @ weeks after treatment were carried out and BMD was measured before and @ and @ weeks after treatment .
METHODS	The effects of time and treatment interaction between these two groups were evaluated by repeated-measure two-factor analysis , and subgroup analysis was performed to examine UVB effect on the vitamin D insufficient group [ serum @ ( OH ) D@ concentration < @ ng/mL ] .
RESULTS	In vitamin D insufficient group , the effect of UVB irradiation on vitamin D and bone ALP as well as additional benefit on bone formation was confirmed .
RESULTS	The vitamin D insufficient group showed statistically significant increment in serum @ ( OH ) D@ compared with the normal group ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , there was no significant difference between two groups in the other bone turnover markers , such as serum calcium , PTH-C , serum osteocalcin , serum CTX and BMD .
CONCLUSIONS	Low-energy-short-term UVB radiation for postmenopausal women may be of use in vitamin D synthesis .
CONCLUSIONS	There was a modest benefit in change of bone ALP especially in women with the insufficient vitamin D.

OBJECTIVE	The US Food and Drug Administration has said that oral preparations containing benzocaine should only be used in infants under strict medical supervision , due to the rare , but potentially fatal , risk of methemoglobinemia .
OBJECTIVE	This study aimed to determine the analgesic effect of topical application of benzocaine prior to lingual frenotomy in infants with symptomatic tongue-tie .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that the duration of crying immediately following frenotomy with topical benzocaine would be shorter than with no benzocaine .
METHODS	This randomised controlled study compared the length of crying after lingual frenotomy in term infants who did , or did not , receive topical application of benzocaine to the lingual frenulum prior to the procedure .
RESULTS	We recruited @ infants to this study .
RESULTS	Crying time was less than one minute in all of the subjects .
RESULTS	The average length of crying in the benzocaine group ( @ @ sec ) was longer than the length of crying in the control group ( @ @ sec ) , p = @ .
CONCLUSIONS	Contrary to our hypothesis , infants who were treated with topical benzocaine did not benefit from topical analgesia in terms of crying time .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of benzocaine for analgesia prior to lingual frenotomy in term infants should therefore be discouraged .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate healthcare utilization and costs following a cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) screening and educational special intervention ( SI ) compared with a control intervention ( CIN ) at @ year in the Family-Based Intervention Trial for Heart Health .
METHODS	Participants randomized to SI for screening and periodic lifestyle counseling were compared with participants randomized to CIN for resource utilization and associated costs at @ year .
METHODS	A total of @ participants ( @ % women and @ % minorities ) were healthy family members of hospitalized patients with CVD who had @-year follow-up resource utilization data .
METHODS	Resource utilization was systematically measured using a standardized questionnaire in both study groups and was validated by medical records in a subsample .
METHODS	Outcomes included provider visits , diagnostic studies , laboratory assessment , medication use , behavioral program enrollment , emergency department ( ED ) visits , hospital admissions , and healthcare costs .
RESULTS	At @ year , there were significantly fewer overall provider visits ( P = @ ) and psychiatrist visits ( P = @ ) in SI versus CIN .
RESULTS	There was a nonsignificant trend toward fewer ED visits , decreased hospital admissions , and shorter inpatient length of stay in SI versus CIN .
RESULTS	Estimated healthcare expenditures for CIN exceeded those for SI by $ @ per participant .
RESULTS	The cost of the @-year intervention was $ @ per participant .
CONCLUSIONS	A @-year standardized low-cost screening and educational intervention was associated with significantly fewer provider visits and with a nonsignificant trend toward reduced healthcare utilization for several parameters .
CONCLUSIONS	The long-term effect on outcomes and costs deserves further study .

BACKGROUND	Previous studies have observed an altitude-dependent increase in central apneas and a shift towards lighter sleep at altitudes > @ m. Whether altitude-dependent changes in the sleep EEG are also prevalent at moderate altitudes of @ m and @ m remains largely unknown .
BACKGROUND	Furthermore , the relationship between sleep EEG variables and central apneas and oxygen saturation are of great interest to understand the impact of hypoxia at moderate altitude on sleep .
METHODS	Fourty-four healthy men ( mean age @ @ years ) underwent polysomnographic recordings during a baseline night at @ m and four consecutive nights at @ m and @ m ( two nights each ) in a randomized cross-over design .
RESULTS	Comparison of sleep EEG power density spectra of frontal ( F@A@ ) and central ( C@A@ ) derivations at altitudes compared to baseline revealed that slow-wave activity ( SWA , @-@ @ Hz ) in non-REM sleep was reduced in an altitude-dependent manner ( ~ @ % at @ m and @ % at @ m ) , while theta activity ( @-@ Hz ) was reduced only at the highest altitude ( @ % at @ m ) .
RESULTS	In addition , spindle peak height and frequency showed a modest increase in the second night at @ m. SWA and theta activity were also reduced in REM sleep .
RESULTS	Correlations between spectral power and central apnea/hypopnea index ( AHI ) , oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) , and oxygen saturation revealed that distinct frequency bands were correlated with oxygen saturation ( @-@ Hz and @-@ @ Hz ) and breathing variables ( AHI , ODI ; @-@ @ Hz ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The correlation between SWA and AHI/ODI suggests that respiratory disturbances contribute to the reduction in SWA at altitude .
CONCLUSIONS	Since SWA is a marker of sleep homeostasis , this might be indicative of an inability to efficiently dissipate sleep pressure .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate , in a randomized controlled way , the use of a daytime wetting alarm in a day-care center during three consecutive weeks in healthy children .
METHODS	Thirty-nine healthy young children , between @ and @ months old , were selected at random for a wetting alarm diaper training ( n = @ ) or control wearing a placebo alarm ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Toilet behavior was observed during a period of @ hr by independent observers before , at the end of , and @ weeks after training .
METHODS	Children were defined as completing daytime toilet training when the child wore undergarments , showed awareness of a need to void , initiated the toileting without prompts or reminder from the trainer and had maximum one leakage accident per day .
RESULTS	Children in the wetting alarm diaper training group achieved independent bladder control in @ % and did significantly better than in the control group ( @ % ) ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The results were sustained during the following @ days ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The wetting alarm diaper training is an effective option for toilet training young healthy children in a day-care center .
CONCLUSIONS	It offers day-care providers clear guidelines and limits the time to complete toilet training in many children without putting too much burden on the child and the day-care center activities .

BACKGROUND	Recent evidence showed that ultrasound-guided embryo transfer significantly increases successful implantation compared to the clinical touch method .
BACKGROUND	It has been postulated that new echodense catheters which are more readily detectable by ultrasound may refine transfer techniques even more , thus improving IVF outcome .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , controlled trial comparing IVF outcome for women undergoing embryo transfer under ultrasound guidance by a single healthcare provider with random assignment according to a computer-generated randomization table to either standard soft Wallace catheter ( standard catheter group , n = @ ) or the new echogenic soft Wallace catheter ( echogenic catheter group , n = @ ) .
RESULTS	The use of the echodense catheter facilitated catheter identification under ultrasound , and thus the duration of the embryo transfer procedure since the loaded catheter was handed to the physician and up to embryo discharge was significantly shorter in the echogenic catheter group as compared with the standard catheter group .
RESULTS	There were @ and @ clinical pregnancies in the standard catheter ( @ % ) and echogenic catheter ( @ % ) groups , respectively .
RESULTS	This was not statistically significant ( P = @ ) according to the OR ( @ ) and CIs ( @-@ @ ) .
RESULTS	However , twin pregnancy rate was significantly increased ( P < @ ) with the use of the new catheter which was the underlying source for obtaining significant increase in implantation rate in this group ( @ % ) as compared with the standard catheter group ( @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	This pilot study suggests that the use of the echogenic Wallace catheter simplifies ultrasound-guided embryo transfer but not definite benefit in terms of pregnancy rates was obtained .
CONCLUSIONS	In contrast , the use of the new catheter was associated with a significant increase in the number of twin pregnancies .

BACKGROUND	Although current clinical guidelines recommend the use of thrombus aspiration ( TA ) during primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) , previous studies evaluating TA demonstrated contradictory results .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term clinical outcome after TA in adjunct to PPCI for acute ST-segment myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , as compared with conventional treatment , with the use of paclitaxel-eluting stents or bare-metal stents .
METHODS	We analyzed data of the PASSION trial , in which @ patients with STEMI were randomly assigned to a paclitaxel-eluting stent or a bare-metal stent .
METHODS	TA was performed in @ patients ( @ % ) .
METHODS	Clinical endpoints at @ years were compared between patients who received TA during PPCI with patients who underwent conventional PPCI .
METHODS	The primary outcome of interest was a composite of cardiac death , recurrent myocardial infarction ( MI ) , or target-lesion revascularization ( TLR ) .
METHODS	A propensity score model was made to account for baseline differences that could have affected the probability of performing TA .
RESULTS	Complete follow-up was available for @ patients ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The cumulative incidence of the combined outcome measure of cardiac death , recurrent MI , or TLR was @ ( @ % ) in the TA group and @ ( @ % ) in the conventional PPCI group ( HR @ ; @ % CI @-@ @ ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Also after adjusting for propensity score , no significant difference in event rate was observed between both treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In this post-hoc analysis of the PASSION trial , TA in adjunct to PPCI did not affect rates of major adverse cardiac events at @ years follow-up , as compared with conventional PPCI .

OBJECTIVE	The main objective was to compare the presence of interlayer gaps between @ hybrid composites placed using a microlayer and a @-layer technique .
METHODS	Standardized Class @ cavities were prepared in @ extracted posterior teeth .
METHODS	Two resin composite materials were used .
METHODS	The control group , group A , consisted of samples of the materials extruded out of the manufacturers ' syringes .
METHODS	Group B consisted of @ teeth restored using @ layers per restoration .
METHODS	Group C consisted of @ teeth restored using @ microlayers per restoration .
METHODS	A scanning electron microscope was used to detect voids in the samples .
RESULTS	Round , well-defined voids were found in @ % to @ % of the samples within the bulks of the resin composite materials only .
RESULTS	A statistically significant relationship between the type of composite and presence of bubbles ( Fisher exact test , P = @ ) was found among the @-layer technique group .
RESULTS	No statistically significant difference ( Fisher exact test , P = @ ) was found among the microlayer technique group .
RESULTS	Irregular interlayer gaps were found in @ % to @ % of specimens within areas between bulks of composite , as detected by an electron microscope based on the different densities of the bulks of composite and the interlayer areas .
RESULTS	No such statistically significant relationship was found ( Fisher exact , P = @ ) among the study groups .
CONCLUSIONS	Voids are routinely found in bulks of composite materials .
CONCLUSIONS	Higher incidences of interlayer gaps in the @-layer samples suggest that the use of a microlayering technique may result in fewer gaps .

BACKGROUND	Several recent randomized trials comparing everolimus-eluting stent ( EES ) and sirolimus-eluting stent ( SES ) reported similar outcomes .
BACKGROUND	However , only @ trial was powered for a clinical end point , and no trial was powered for evaluating target-lesion revascularization .
RESULTS	Randomized Evaluation of Sirolimus-eluting versus Everolimus-eluting stent Trial is a prospective multicenter randomized open-label trial comparing EES with SES in Japan .
RESULTS	The trial was powered for evaluating noninferiority of EES relative to SES in terms of target-lesion revascularization .
RESULTS	From February and July @ , @ patients were randomly assigned to receive either EES ( @ patients ) or SES ( @ patients ) .
RESULTS	At @ year , the primary efficacy end point of target-lesion revascularization occurred in @ patients ( @ % ) in the EES group and in @ patients ( @ % ) in the SES group , demonstrating noninferiority of EES to SES ( P ( noninferiority ) < @ , and P ( superiority ) = @ ) .
RESULTS	Cumulative incidence of definite stent thrombosis was low and similar between the @ groups ( @ % versus @ % , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	An angiographic substudy enrolling @ patients ( EES , @ patients and SES , @ patients ) demonstrated noninferiority of EES relative to SES regarding the primary angiographic end point of in-segment late loss ( @ mm versus @ mm , P ( noninferiority ) < @ , and P ( superiority ) = @ ) at @ days after index stent implantation .
CONCLUSIONS	One-year clinical and angiographic outcome after EES implantation was noninferior to and not different from that after SES implantation in a stable coronary artery disease population with relatively less complex coronary anatomy .
CONCLUSIONS	One-year clinical outcome after both EES and SES use was excellent with a low rate of target-lesion revascularization and a very low rate of stent thrombosis .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) reduces urinary calcium excretion in dogs with calcium oxalate urolithiasis .
METHODS	Original study .
METHODS	@ dogs with calcium oxalate urolithiasis .
METHODS	@ treatment protocols were evaluated in each dog ( a low calcium , low protein diet designed to prevent calcium oxalate urolith formation with and without administration of HCTZ [ @ mg/kg ( @ mg/lb ) of body weight , PO , q @ h ] and a maintenance diet with higher quantities of protein and calcium with and without administration of HCTZ ) .
METHODS	At the end of each @-week treatment period , @-hour urine samples were collected .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected during the midpoint of each urine collection period .
METHODS	Analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the effects of HCTZ and diet on urine and serum analytes .
RESULTS	Hydrochlorothiazide significantly decreased urine calcium and potassium concentration and excretion .
RESULTS	Hydrochlorothiazide also significantly decreased serum potassium concentration .
RESULTS	Compared with the maintenance diet , the urolith prevention diet significantly decreased urine calcium and oxalic acid concentration and excretion .
RESULTS	Dogs consuming the urolith prevention diet had significantly lower serum concentrations of albumin and urea nitrogen .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of HCTZ decreased urine calcium excretion in dogs with a history of calcium oxalate urolith formation .
CONCLUSIONS	The greatest reduction in urine calcium concentration and excretion was achieved when dogs received HCTZ and the urolith prevention diet .
CONCLUSIONS	Results of this study suggest that the hypocalciuric effect of HCTZ will minimize recurrence of calcium oxalate urolith formation in dogs ; however , long-term controlled clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of HCTZ .

BACKGROUND	Riboflavin-fortified salt is now supplied in the diet for residents who live in high incidence areas for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China .
METHODS	All residents from @ townships in Cixian , Hebei province were divided into an intervention group ( @ townships , @,@ people ) who took up riboflavin-fortified salt and a control group ( @ townships , @,@ people ) who were free from riboflavin-fortified salt .
METHODS	Some @,@ of the control group and @ of the intervention group were randomly selected to undergo endoscopy examination using iodine dying with multi-point biopsy and histopathology examination .
METHODS	Among them @ of the intervention group and @ of the control group were tested for the blood riboflavin level with reference to the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient ( EGRAC ) .
METHODS	Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence data were further obtained from the Cixian Cancer Registry .
RESULTS	The results of endoscopy suggested the mucosal status of the intervention group to be better than that of the control group .
RESULTS	It showed @ % of the mucosal status of control group to be normal , @ % to have dysplasia , and @ % pre-cancer or cancer , respectively , as compared to @ % , @ % and @ % , respectively , for the intervention group .
RESULTS	The mean EGRAC values for the intervention and control groups were @ and @ , respectively ( P < @ ) ; compared with normal mucous membrane of esophagus , the lack of riboflavin increased the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( OR = @ , @ % CI = @ approximately @ ) , but the risk of dysplasia did not increase ( OR = @ , @ % CI = @-@ @ ) ; after intervention , the six years average esophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence of the intervention group ( @ / @,@ ) was lower than in the control group ( @ / @,@ ) , although there was no statistical significance ( u = @ , P > @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	It proved practical and effective to improve the status of riboflavin and esophageal mucosa by taking up riboflavin-fortified salt .

BACKGROUND	Untreated behavioral and mental health problems beginning in early childhood are costly problems affecting the long-term health and wellbeing of children , their families , and society .
BACKGROUND	Although parent training ( PT ) programs have been demonstrated to be a cost-effective intervention modality for treating childhood behavior problems , they have been less effective for children from low-income and underserved racial and ethnic populations .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this randomized trial is to compare the effectiveness , cost , and social validity of two manualized evidence-based PT programs that were developed and tested on different populations and employ different delivery models : ( @ ) The Chicago Parent Program ( CPP ) , a group-based program developed in collaboration with a community advisory board of African-American and Latino parents ; and ( @ ) Parent-Child Interaction Therapy ( PCIT ) , an individualized parent-child coaching model considered to be ` the gold standard ' for parents of children with externalizing behavior problems .
METHODS	This trial uses an experimental design with randomization of parents seeking behavioral treatment for their @ - to @-year-old children at a mental health clinic in Baltimore , MD ( @ % African-American or multi-racial ; @ % receiving Medicaid ) .
METHODS	Using block randomization procedures , @ parents are randomized to CPP or PCIT .
METHODS	Clinicians ( n = @ ) employed in the mental health clinic and trained in CPP or PCIT are also recruited to participate .
METHODS	Primary outcomes of interest are reductions in child behavior problems , improvements in parenting , perceived value of the interventions from the perspective of parents and clinicians , and cost .
METHODS	Parent distress and family social risk are assessed as modifiers of treatment effectiveness .
METHODS	We hypothesize that CPP will be at least as effective as PCIT for reducing child behavior problems and improving parenting but the programs will differ on cost and their social validity as perceived by parents and clinicians .
CONCLUSIONS	This is the first study to compare the effectiveness of a PT program originally designed with and for parents from underserved racial and ethnic populations ( CPP ) against a well-established program considered to be the ` the gold standard ' ( PCIT ) with a high-risk population of parents .
CONCLUSIONS	Challenges related to conducting a randomized trial in a fee-for-service mental health clinic serving urban , low-income families are discussed .

BACKGROUND	End-stage renal disease and the need for chronic hemodialysis is an indication for hepatitis B vaccination , but up to half of dialysis patients fail to respond to a @ microg/dose i.m. three-dose primary series of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine .
BACKGROUND	Only another @-@ % respond to additional boosting doses of vaccine .
METHODS	Since GM-CSF has been shown to be an effective adjuvant for hepatitis B vaccine in healthy subjects and multiple animal vaccine models , we conducted a randomized , double-blind trial of GM-CSF with recombinant hepatitis B vaccine in chronic hemodialysis patients .
METHODS	Patients with negative hepatitis B surface antibody and antigen who had received at least three doses of recombinant hepatitis B vaccine without response ( antibody titre < @ mIU/ml ) were randomized to placebo , @ microg , or @ microg of GM-CSF given with @ microg recombinant hepatitis B vaccine i.m. at the same site .
METHODS	Clinical and laboratory studies for safety assessment were done on days @ and @ , and hepatitis B surface antibody titres were measured at baseline and days @ and @ after the study injections .
RESULTS	No significant local or systemic toxicity was noted from the co-injections .
RESULTS	The rates of response and geometric mean titre ( GMT ) were equivalent among all three study groups : placebo @/@ developed antibodies , GMT @ mIU/ml ; @ microg GM-CSF @/@ developed antibodies , GMT @ mIU ; and @ microg GM-CSF @/@ developed antibodies , GMT @ mIU/ml .
RESULTS	Six months after vaccination , antibody titres were available for @ of the @ day @ positive responders ; only @ of these @ patients remained antibody positive at @ months .
CONCLUSIONS	GM-CSF given in a single @ microg and @ microg i.m. dose was not an effective adjuvant with hepatitis B vaccine in chronic hemodialysis patients who had previously failed to respond to hepatitis B immunization .

BACKGROUND	The incidence of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) in rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) is increased compared to the general population .
BACKGROUND	Immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation are thought to be associated with this increased risk .
BACKGROUND	Early diagnosis with immediate treatment and tight control of RA forms a central treatment paradigm .
BACKGROUND	It remains unclear , however , whether using tumor necrosis factor inhibitors ( TNFi ) to achieve remission confer additional beneficial effects over standard therapy , especially on the development of CVD .
METHODS	Coronary Artery Disease Evaluation in Rheumatoid Arthritis ( CADERA ) is a prospective cardiovascular imaging study that bolts onto an existing single-centre , randomized controlled trial , VEDERA ( Very Early versus Delayed Etanercept in Rheumatoid Arthritis ) .
METHODS	VEDERA will recruit @ patients with early , treatment-nave RA , randomized to TNFi therapy etanercept ( ETN ) combined with methotrexate ( MTX ) , or therapy with MTX with or without additional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs with escalation to ETN following a ` treat-to-target ' regimen .
METHODS	VEDERA patients will be recruited into CADERA and undergo cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) assessment with ; cine imaging , rest/stress adenosine perfusion , tissue-tagging , aortic distensibility , T@ mapping and late gadolinium imaging .
METHODS	Primary objectives are to detect the prevalence and change of cardiovascular abnormalities by CMR between TNFi and standard therapy over a @-month period .
METHODS	All patients will enter an inflammatory arthritis registry for long-term follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS	CADERA is a multi-parametric study describing cardiovascular abnormalities in early , treatment-nave RA patients , with assessment of changes at one year between early biological therapy and conventional therapy .
BACKGROUND	This trial was registered with Current Controlled Trials ( registration number : ISRCTN@ ) on @ November @ .

BACKGROUND	Appendicitis is the most common emergency condition in children .
BACKGROUND	Historically , a @-drug regimen consisting of ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin ( AGC ) has been used postoperatively for perforated appendicitis .
BACKGROUND	A retrospective review at our institution has found single day dosing of ceftriaxone and metronidazole ( CM ) to be a more simple and cost-effective antibiotic strategy .
BACKGROUND	Therefore , we performed a prospective , randomized trial to compare efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these @ regimens .
METHODS	After internal review board approval ( IRB no. @ @-@ ) , children found to have perforated appendicitis at appendectomy were randomized to either once daily dosing of CM ( @ total doses per day ) or standard dosing of AGC ( @ total doses per day ) .
METHODS	Perforation was defined as an identifiable hole in the appendix .
METHODS	The operative approach ( laparoscopic ) , length of antibiotic use , and criteria for discharge were standardized for the groups .
METHODS	Based on our retrospective analysis using length of postoperative hospitalization as a primary end point , a sample size of @ patients was calculated for an alpha of @ and a power of @ .
RESULTS	One hundred patients underwent laparoscopic appendectomy for perforated appendicitis .
RESULTS	On presentation , there were no differences in sex distribution , days of symptoms , temperature , or leukocyte count .
RESULTS	There was no difference in abscess rate or wound infections between groups .
RESULTS	The CM group resulted in significantly less antibiotic charges then the AGC group .
CONCLUSIONS	Once daily dosing with the @-drug regimen ( CM ) offers a more efficient , cost-effective antibiotic management in children with perforated appendicitis without compromising infection control when compared to a traditional @-drug regimen .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the safety and efficacy with respect to the control of calculus and stain of two power toothbrushes .
METHODS	This was a cross-over study involving a total of @ subjects from a general population who used , in a randomized sequence , the Braun Oral-B @D Excel ( D@ ) and the Sonicare toothbrush with a conventional dentifrice , and a manual brush with a tartar control dentifrice .
METHODS	The manual toothbrush with tartar control dentifrice served as a positive control with respect to control of calculus .
METHODS	Following @ weeks of manual brush use with a conventional , non-abrasive dentifrice , each test brush was used for a period of @ weeks , after which subjects switched to the next brush in the sequence .
METHODS	Calculus was scored using the Volpe-Manhold Calculus Index and stain using the Lobene Stain Index .
RESULTS	All three brushes were found to be safe as used in the study .
RESULTS	All three toothbrushes significantly reduced the levels of calculus as compared to the control period .
RESULTS	Reduction from baseline in the rate of calculus formation was greatest in the D@ group ( @ % ) , followed by the manual brush with tartar control dentifrice ( @ % ) and Sonicare ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Both the D@ and the manual brush were significantly more effective than Sonicare ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The D@ was also more effective at controlling stain formation than either Sonicare or the manual brush with tartar control dentifrice at the gingival margin , the difference from Sonicare being statistically significant for all analyses ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	It is concluded that the D@ is significantly more effective in reducing both the rate of calculus and stain formation than the Sonicare toothbrush .

###19089501
OBJECTIVE	We evaluated the association between physicians ' communication behavior and breast cancer patients ' trust in their physicians .
METHODS	Longitudinal survey conducted at baseline , @-month , and @-month follow-up during first year of diagnosis .
METHODS	Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients ( N = @ ) .
METHODS	We collected data on patient perceptions of the helpfulness of informational , emotional , and decision-making support provided by physicians and patients ' trust .
METHODS	Linear regression models evaluated the association of concurrent and prior levels of physician support with patients ' trust .
RESULTS	At baseline , patients who received helpful informational , emotional , and decision-making support from physicians reported greater trust ( p < @ , p < @ , and p < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	At the @-month assessment , baseline informational support and informational and emotional support at @-months were associated with greater trust ( p < @ , p < @ , and p < @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	At the @-month assessment , only helpful emotional support from physicians at @ months was associated with greater trust ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Interestingly , while perceived helpfulness of all three types of physician support decreased significantly over time , patient trust remained high and unchanged .
CONCLUSIONS	Findings suggest that while informational and decision-making support may be more important to patient trust early in the course of treatment , emotional support from physicians may be important to maintain trust throughout the initial year of diagnosis .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy and tolerability of oral risedronate and etidronate for treatment of Paget 's disease of bone .
METHODS	Patients from @ centers in North America received risedronate @ mg daily for @ months ( @ patients ) or etidronate @ mg daily for @ months ( @ patients ) in a prospective , randomized , double-blind study .
METHODS	Serum alkaline phosphatase ( the primary variable ) , serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase , and urinary deoxypyridinoline concentrations were monitored for @ to @ months .
RESULTS	Serum alkaline phosphatase concentration normalized by month @ in @ % of risedronate-treated patients , compared with @ % of those receiving etidronate ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Median time to normalization was @ days for risedronate-treated patients and > @ days for etidronate-treated patients ( P < @ ) ; relapse rates were @ % in the risedronate group and @ % in the etidronate group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	At month @ , @ % of the risedronate group and @ % of the etidronate group remained in biochemical remission .
RESULTS	Urinary deoxypyridinoline normalized in @ % of patients on risedronate and @ % of patients receiving etidronate ( P < @ ) ; serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase normalized in @ % of patients on risedronate and @ % of patients on etidronate ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients who had received etidronate previously had a blunted response to etidronate , but not to risedronate .
RESULTS	Reductions in pain were statistically significant in the risedronate group , but not in the etidronate group .
RESULTS	Both drugs were well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	Although etidronate is effective , risedronate offers a shorter duration of therapy , better and longer-lasting remission , significant reductions in pain , and provides additional remission in subjects who exhibited an incomplete response to previous etidronate treatment .

###10735426
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the utility of low-dose irradiation as adjunctive treatment for failing dialysis shunts related to stenoses .
METHODS	Thirty-one patients with @ lesions in their dialysis shunts were successfully enrolled for this study .
METHODS	After imaging of the shunt and calculation of venous stenoses , each patient was randomized into one of two segments of the protocol : ( i ) angioplasty and/or stent placement alone , and ( ii ) angioplasty and/or stent placement followed by external beam irradiation .
METHODS	All patients with significant venous stenoses ( > or = @ % ) were treated with appropriately sized PTA ( percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ) and Wallstents .
METHODS	Patients randomized to the external irradiation segment underwent localized irradiation via a Theratron cobalt unit of @ Gy @-@ hours and @-@ hours after intervention .
METHODS	Those patients randomized to the control group received no additional treatment .
METHODS	Clinical follow-up included resumption of successful dialysis with appropriate hemodynamic parameters .
METHODS	Two follow-up shunt images were obtained , follow-up @ ( fu-@ ) from @ to @ days and follow-up @ ( fu-@ ) from @ to @ days .
METHODS	Percentages of significant recurrent stenoses , defined as greater than @ % , were recorded and re-treated as needed .
RESULTS	Sixteen of the @ patients underwent external beam irradiation .
RESULTS	There were @ lesions in the test group that underwent irradiation after intervention , and @ lesions were treated with intervention alone .
RESULTS	There were seven native arteriovenous fistulas and @ Gore-tex grafts .
RESULTS	All stenoses were either venous outflow stenoses ( @ % ) or central stenoses ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The authors utilized chi@ analysis to compare restenoses rates between the control and irradiated groups at fu-@ ( P < @ ) and fu-@ ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the results show that external beam irradiation has minimal effects on the restenoses of dialysis grafts when used in conjunction with PTA and stent placement , further studies with a larger , more homogenous population are needed to assess the trend of improving patency rates after external beam irradiation .

BACKGROUND	Fractional laser therapy ( FLT ) has become a widely accepted modality for skin rejuvenation and has also been used in various other skin diseases .
OBJECTIVE	To observe long-term histologic effects of nonablative and ablative FLT in the treatment of pigment disorders .
METHODS	A randomized controlled observer-blinded study was performed in @ patients with pigment disorders .
METHODS	Two similar test regions were randomized to receive FLT with intermittent topical bleaching or topical bleaching alone .
METHODS	Patients with ashy dermatosis ( AD ) and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation ( PIH ) were treated using nonablative @,@-nm FLT ( @mJ/microbeam , @-@ % coverage ) , whereas patients with Becker 's nevus ( BN ) were treated with ablative @,@-nm FLT ( @mJ/microbeam , @-@ % coverage ) for three to five sessions .
METHODS	Biopsies were obtained @months after the last treatment .
RESULTS	At follow-up , dermal fibrosis was observed in four of eight patients treated using ablative FLT and no patients treated using nonablative FLT ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Assuming that the dermal response is comparable in AD , PIH , and BN , at the given settings , ablative FLT may induce fibrosis , whereas treatment with nonablative FLT does not .
CONCLUSIONS	Whether formation of fibrosis has to be regarded as dermal remodeling or a subtle subclinical form of scarring should be investigated in future research .

OBJECTIVE	Postoperative air leakage is the most frequent complication after pulmonary surgery .
OBJECTIVE	The development of modern surgical techniques has been influenced strongly by the need to manage air leakage effectively during pulmonary resection .
OBJECTIVE	This study evaluated the effect of using an autologous fibrin sealant ( Vivostat ) during lobectomy on morbidity following surgery .
METHODS	This was a prospective , blinded , randomised clinical study .
METHODS	Patients undergoing lobectomy were enrolled into two groups ( Vivostat or non-treatment control , @ per group ) .
METHODS	Air leakage was measured over a @-h period ( using a mechanical suction pump ) on the day of operation , and both air leakage and bleeding/exudation ( drainage volume ) were recorded every morning postoperatively until the chest tubes were removed .
METHODS	Personnel recording these parameters were blinded to the intervention received .
RESULTS	Compared with the control group , mean bleeding/exudate volumes were significantly reduced in the Vivostat group ( day @,@ vs. @ ml ; total , @ vs. @ ml ; both P < @ ) , and drains were inserted for a shorter time ( medians , @ vs. @ days , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Significantly fewer patients had air leakage at any time in the Vivostat group ( @ vs. @ % , P = @ ) , and air leakage volumes were significantly lower compared with the control group ( median differences : day of surgery : @ l/min , P = @ ; total @ l/min , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Postoperative hospitalisation time was shorter in the Vivostat group than in the control group but the difference was not significant ( @ days , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Vivostat fibrin sealant significantly reduces post-surgical air leakage and drainage volumes following lobectomy in pulmonary surgery and is suitable for routine use in this procedure .

OBJECTIVE	As part of the large international , randomized @NN trial , the pharmacokinetics of nevirapine in once-daily @ mg and twice-daily @ mg dosing regimens were investigated .
METHODS	Treatment-naive HIV-@-infected patients were randomized to receive nevirapine @ mg once daily or @ mg twice daily , in combination with lamivudine and stavudine .
METHODS	Blood samples were collected at several time-points ( day @ , weeks @ , @ , @ , @ , and @ ) .
METHODS	Differences in pharmacokinetics between once - versus twice-daily dosing were investigated with nonlinear mixed effects modelling ( NONMEM ) .
RESULTS	In total , @,@ nevirapine plasma concentrations were available from @ patients .
RESULTS	Dosage and dosing frequency did not influence clearance or volume of distribution of nevirapine , indicating linear pharmacokinetic behavior of nevirapine whether given as a single daily dose or as divided doses over @ hours .
RESULTS	During steady state , the Cmin was lower ( @ mg/L vs. @ mg/L ; p < @ ) and the Cmax was higher ( @ mg/L vs. @ mg/L ; p < @ ) in the once-daily arm .
RESULTS	However , compared to total variability in nevirapine levels for both treatments , these differences were minor .
RESULTS	During steady state , total exposure , measured as AUC@h , was comparable for both regimens ( @ mg/L * h vs. @ mg/L * h ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The daily exposure to nevirapine ( AUC@h ) was similar for the @ mg once-daily and the @ mg twice-daily dosing regimens .
CONCLUSIONS	The Cmin of nevirapine is lower and the Cmax of nevirapine is higher for the once-daily regimen as compared to the twice-daily regimen .
CONCLUSIONS	As a result , @ mg nevirapine dosed twice daily may be preferred over @ mg nevirapine dosed once daily .

BACKGROUND	The intake of @ g/day of short-chain-fructo-oligosaccharides ( sc-FOS ) has been shown to increase significantly bifidus counts and to produce high amounts of short-chain fatty acids ( SCFA ) , presumed to influence glucose and lipid metabolism .
OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of moderate intake of sc-FOS on glucose and lipid metabolism in individuals with mild hypercholesterolaemia .
METHODS	A randomized double-blind sequential cross-over study .
METHODS	Thirty subjects of both genders ( @ M/@ F ) , mean age @ + / -@ years ( M + / - SD ) , BMI @ + / -@ kg/m ( @ ) , with plasma cholesterol > @ and < @ mmol/l and plasma triglycerides < @ mmol/l , participated in the study .
METHODS	The study was performed after a wash-out period of @ month and a run-in period of @ month to stabilize patients on a standard diet ( CHO @ % , fat @ % , protein @ % , fibre @ g/day ) plus placebo ( maltodextrine plus aspartame @ g/day ) .
METHODS	At the end of run-in , subjects were randomly assigned to receive sc-FOS ( Actilight ) ( @ g/day ) or placebo ( maltodextrine plus aspartame @ g/day ) with tea and/or coffee for a duration of @ months and thereafter switched to the other treatment for additional @ months .
METHODS	Plasma glucose , total and lipoprotein ( VLDL , LDL , HDL ) cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured in the fasting state at the end of run-in and of each treatment period .
METHODS	At the end of the two treatment periods , patients consumed a standard test meal ( protein @ % , carbohydrate @ % , fat @ % , kJ @ ) @h after the administration of @ g of sc-FOS or placebo ; plasma glucose , insulin , free fatty acid ( FFA ) and triglyceride responses to the test meal were evaluated .
RESULTS	No significant difference in fasting parameters was detected between the two treatments .
RESULTS	After sc-FOS and placebo plasma cholesterol levels were , respectively , @ + / -@ and @ + / -@ mmol/l ( n.s. ) and plasma triglycerides were @ + / -@ and @ + / -@ mmol/l ( n.s. ) .
RESULTS	No significant differences were observed in cholesterol and triglyceride content of VLDL , LDL and HDL and in plasma Apo A@ levels ; conversely , fasting plasma Lp ( a ) concentrations were significantly increased after sc-FOS ( @ + / -@ vs. @ + / -@ mg/dl ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Postprandial responses of glucose , FFA and triglycerides were not significantly different between sc-FOS and placebo , while postprandial insulin response ( incremental area ) was significantly reduced after sc-FOS compared to placebo ( @,@ + / -@ vs. @,@ + / -@ pmol/l x @ min ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A moderate intake of sc-FOS has no major effects on lipid metabolism , both in the fasting and in the postprandial period , in individuals with mild hypercholesterolaemia .
CONCLUSIONS	A small but significant increase of Lp ( a ) concentrations was observed with sc-FOS consumption together with a reduction of the postprandial insulin response ; however , the clinical relevance of these small effects is unclear .

BACKGROUND	Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA testing has shown higher sensitivity than cytology for detecting cervical lesions , but it is uncertain whether the higher sensitivity is dependent on the age of the woman being screened .
BACKGROUND	We compared the age-specific performance of primary HPV DNA screening with that of conventional cytology screening in the setting of an organized population-based cervical cancer screening program in Finland .
METHODS	From January @ , @ , to December @ , @ , randomized invitations were sent to women aged @-@ years for routine cervical cancer screening by primary high-risk HPV DNA testing ( n = @ @ ) with a Hybrid Capture @ assay followed by cytology triage for women who were HPV DNA positive or by conventional cytology screening ( n = @ @ ) .
METHODS	In both screening arms , cytology results of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or worse triggered a referral for colposcopy .
METHODS	Relative rates ( RRs ) of detection to assess test sensitivity , specificity , and positive predictive values ( PPVs ) with @ % confidence intervals ( CIs ) were calculated for the histological endpoints of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) grade @ or higher ( CIN @ + ) , CIN grade @ or higher ( CIN @ + ) , and CIN grade @ or higher ( CIN @ + ) .
METHODS	All statistical tests were two-sided .
RESULTS	The overall frequency of colposcopy referrals was @ % in both screening arms .
RESULTS	Women younger than @ years were referred more often in the HPV DNA screening vs the conventional screening arm ( RR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	The prevalence of histologically confirmed CIN or cancer was @ % in the HPV DNA screening arm vs @ % in the conventional screening arm .
RESULTS	The relative rates of detection for CIN @ , CIN @ , and CIN @ + for HPV DNA screening with cytology triage vs conventional screening were @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ ) , @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ ) , and @ ( @ % CI = @ to @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	The specificity of the HPV DNA test with cytology triage was equal to that of conventional screening for all age groups ( @ % vs @ % for CIN @ + , P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among women aged @ years or older , the HPV DNA test with cytology triage tended to have higher specificity than conventional screening .
RESULTS	The PPVs for HPV DNA screening with cytology triage were consistently higher than those for conventional screening .
RESULTS	In both screening arms , the test specificities increased with increasing age of the women being screening , whereas the highest PPVs were observed among the youngest women being screened .
RESULTS	Overall , @ % of women in the HPV DNA screening arm vs @ % of women in the conventional screening arm were recommended for intensified follow-up , and the percentages were highest among @ - to @-year-olds ( @ % vs @ % , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Primary HPV DNA screening with cytology triage is more sensitive than conventional screening .
CONCLUSIONS	Among women aged @ years or older , primary HPV DNA screening with cytology triage is also more specific than conventional screening and decreases colposcopy referrals and follow-up tests .

OBJECTIVE	To quantify absorption of colostral IgG by healthy neonatal foals and to test the hypothesis that delayed ingestion of macromolecules prolongs the duration of intestinal permeability to immunoglobulins ( Ig ) in newborn foals .
METHODS	Thirteen mixed breed foals .
METHODS	Foals were randomly assigned to two treatment groups , which were fed either a glucose-electrolyte solution or a commercial milk replacer for @ h after birth , before being fed a known amount of colostral IgG .
METHODS	A control group was fed a known amount of colostral IgG from birth .
METHODS	The efficiency of IgG absorption was calculated following determination of plasma IgG concentration for each foal .
RESULTS	Foals given colostrum immediately after birth transferred approximately @ % of ingested IgG into their vascular space .
RESULTS	Delayed colostral ingestion significantly reduced the amount of IgG absorbed by foals .
RESULTS	Withholding macromolecules for @ h had no effect on the subsequent efficiency of IgG absorption .
CONCLUSIONS	Colostrum should be supplied to foals within @ h of birth for best uptake of Ig .
CONCLUSIONS	The type of fluid administered to foals before the ingestion of colostrum does not influence subsequent absorption of Ig , suggesting that the process of gut closure in foals is not mediated by a finite capacity for macromolecular uptake .

BACKGROUND	The pathogenesis of the post cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) organ dysfunction syndrome is complex , with inflammation being an important component .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this prospective , randomized and controlled study was to evaluate the effect of a single dose of pentoxifylline ( PTX ) prior to CPB on high dependency unit time .
METHODS	We studied @ patients undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery with CPB .
METHODS	Patients received either @ mg kg ( -@ ) PTX after induction of anaesthesia or saline as placebo .
METHODS	Haemodynamics , parameters of pulmonary function and plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) were measured after the induction of anaesthesia ( pre-CPB ) and after weaning from CPB ( post-CPB ) , @ h after the admission to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) and on the morning of the first postoperative day ( @ POD ) , respectively .
METHODS	In addition , ventilation time and the high dependency unit time , i.e. the time till transferral to a peripheral ward , were documented .
RESULTS	Patients in the PTX group had lower TNFalpha values ( @ ng ml ( -@ ) ( @/@ @ ) vs @ ng ml ( -@ ) ( @ / @ ) ) ( median ( @ % / @ % ) , p = @ ) , lower systolic ( @ + / -@ mm Hg vs @ + / - @ mm Hg , mean + / - SD , p = @ ) and mean pulmonary artery pressures ( @ + / -@ vs @ + / -@ mm Hg , p = @ ) after admission to the ICU than control patients .
RESULTS	Haemodynamics and pulmonary function parameters did not differ .
RESULTS	There was a trend towards earlier weaning from the respirator in the PTX group ( @ + / -@ h ) ( min/max : @/@ ; confidence interval ( ConF ) : @ h ) than the control group ( @ + / -@ h ) ( min/max : @-@ ; ConI : @ h ) ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Patients treated with PTX could be transferred to a peripheral ward about @ h earlier than control patients ( @ + / -@ h , min/max : @/@ h ; ConI : @ h ; @ + / -@ h , min/max : @/@ h ; ConI : @ h ) respectively ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	A single dose of PTX prior to CPB was able to reduce plasma levels of TNFalpha .
CONCLUSIONS	In this descriptive study , there was a trend towards reduced duration of ventilation and the high dependency unit time , i.e. the time till transferral to a peripheral ward was shortened .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the roles of immediate pars plana vitrectomy ( VIT ) and systemic antibiotic treatment in the management of postoperative endophthalmitis .
METHODS	Investigator-initiated , multicenter , randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	Private and university-based retina-vitreous practices .
METHODS	A total of @ patients who had clinical evidence of endophthalmitis within @ weeks after cataract surgery or secondary intraocular lens implantation .
METHODS	Random assignment according to a @ x @ factorial design to treatment with VIT or vitreous tap or biopsy ( TAP ) and to treatment with or without systemic antibiotics ( ceftazidime and amikacin ) .
METHODS	A @-month evaluation of visual acuity assessed by an Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study acuity chart and media clarity assessed both clinically and photographically .
RESULTS	There was no difference in final visual acuity or media clarity with or without the use of systemic antibiotics .
RESULTS	In patients whose initial visual acuity was hand motions or better , there was no difference in visual outcome whether or not an immediate VIT was performed .
RESULTS	However , in the subgroup of patients with initial light perception-only vision , VIT produced a threefold increase in the frequency of achieving @/@ or better acuity ( @ % vs @ % ) , approximately a twofold chance of achieving @/@ or better acuity ( @ % vs @ % ) , and a @ % decrease in the frequency of severe visual loss ( @ % vs @ % ) over TAP .
RESULTS	In this group of patients , the difference between VIT and TAP was statistically significant ( P < @ , log rank test for cumulative visual acuity scores ) over the entire range of vision .
CONCLUSIONS	Omission of systemic antibiotic treatment can reduce toxic effects , costs , and length of hospital stay .
CONCLUSIONS	Routine immediate VIT is not necessary in patients with better than light perception vision at presentation but is of substantial benefit for those who have light perception-only vision .

OBJECTIVE	To investigate whether intermittent catheterization ( IC ) with a hydrophilic-coated catheter delays the onset of the first symptomatic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) and reduces the number of symptomatic UTIs in patients with acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) compared with IC with standard , uncoated catheters .
METHODS	A prospective , randomized , parallel-group trial .
METHODS	Fifteen North American SCI centers .
METHODS	Participants were followed up while in the hospital or rehabilitation unit ( institutional period ) and up to @ months after institutional discharge ( community period ) .
METHODS	The maximal study period was @ months .
METHODS	A total of @ subjects with traumatic SCI of less than @ months ' duration who use IC .
METHODS	The participants were randomized within @ days of starting IC to either single-use hydrophilic-coated ( SpeediCath ) or polyvinyl chloride uncoated ( Conveen ) catheters .
METHODS	The time from the first catheterization to the first antibiotic-treated symptomatic UTI was measured as well as the total number of symptomatic UTIs during the study period .
RESULTS	The time to the first antibiotic-treated symptomatic UTI was significantly delayed in the hydrophilic-coated catheter group compared with the uncoated catheter group .
RESULTS	The delay corresponded to a @ % decrease in the daily risk of developing the first symptomatic UTI among participants who used the hydrophilic-coated catheter .
RESULTS	In the institutional period , the incidence of antibiotic-treated symptomatic UTIs was reduced by @ % ( P < @ ) in the hydrophilic-coated catheter group .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of a hydrophilic-coated catheter for IC is associated with a delay in the onset of the first antibiotic-treated symptomatic UTI and with a reduction in the incidence of symptomatic UTI in patients with acute SCI during the acute inpatient rehabilitation .
CONCLUSIONS	Using a hydrophilic-coated catheter could minimize UTI-related complications , treatment costs , and rehabilitation delays in this group of patients , and reduce the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms .

BACKGROUND	Women with heart disease have adverse psychosocial profiles and poor attendance in cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) programs .
BACKGROUND	Few studies examine CR programs tailored for women for improving their quality of life ( QOL ) .
METHODS	This randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) compared QOL among women in a traditional CR program with that of women completing a tailored program that included motivational interviewing guided by the Transtheoretical Model ( TTM ) of behavior change .
METHODS	Two measures of QOL , the Multiple Discrepancies Theory questionnaire ( MDT ) and the Self-Anchoring Striving Scale ( SASS ) , were administered to @ women at baseline , postintervention , and @-month follow-up .
METHODS	Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) was used to compare changes in QOL scores over time .
RESULTS	Baseline MDT and SASS scores were @ and @ and @ and @ for the tailored and traditional CR groups , respectively .
RESULTS	Postintervention , MDT and SASS scores increased to @ and @ , respectively , for the tailored group compared with @ and @ for the traditional group .
RESULTS	Follow-up scores were @ and @ for the tailored group and @ and @ for the traditional group .
RESULTS	Significant group by time interactions were found .
RESULTS	Subsequent tests revealed that MDT and SASS scores for the traditional group did not differ over time .
RESULTS	The tailored group showed significantly increased MDT and SASS scores from baseline to posttest , and despite slight attenuation from posttest to @-month follow-up , MDT and SASS scores remained higher than baseline .
CONCLUSIONS	The CR program tailored for women significantly improved global QOL compared with traditional CR .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies should explore the mechanisms by which such programs affect QOL .

BACKGROUND	Although age is the most important variable associated with death among patients with persistent ST-segment elevation , its impact on outcome among patients without persistent ST-segment elevation remains unknown .
BACKGROUND	Moreover , the impact of age on the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy with eptifibatide is unknown .
METHODS	We analyzed the impact of increased age on outcome ( death or [ re ] infarction ) among patients enrolled in PURSUIT ( Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy ) , a prospective , randomized study comparing placebo versus eptifibatide therapy in acute coronary syndromes without persistent ST-segment elevation .
METHODS	The @ patients were divided into @-year age groups : < @ , @-@ , @-@ , @-@ , and > / = @ .
METHODS	In addition , we examined whether age had an impact on the efficacy of eptifibatide therapy .
RESULTS	Eptifibatide improved outcome at @ days ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	There was no interaction among age and treatment ( placebo vs eptifibatide ) and adjusted outcome ( P = @ for death or [ re ] infarction at @ days ) .
RESULTS	Despite their worse clinical profile , older patients were less likely to undergo coronary angiography at @ days : @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , and @ ( @ % ) in the respective age groups .
RESULTS	Death or ( re ) infarction at @ days occurred in @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , and @ ( @ % ) in the respective age groups , and at @ months in @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , @ ( @ % ) , and @ ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	For a @-year difference in age group , the adjusted odds for death or ( re ) infarction were greater by @ % within @ days and by @ % within @ months .
RESULTS	These trends persisted for patients with or without myocardial infarction on presentation .
CONCLUSIONS	Age did not significantly affect the efficacy of eptifibatide .

OBJECTIVE	Cost concerns may inhibit emergency medical services ( EMS ) use .
OBJECTIVE	Novel tax-based and subscription prepayment programs indemnify patients against the cost of EMS treatment and transport .
OBJECTIVE	We determine whether the presence of ( or enrollment in ) prepayment plans increase EMS use among patients with acute chest discomfort , particularly those residing in low-income areas , those lacking private insurance , or both .
METHODS	This study uses a subset of baseline data from the REACT trial , a multicenter , randomized controlled community trial designed , in part , to increase EMS use .
METHODS	The sample includes @ consecutive noninstitutionalized patients ( > @ years old ) presenting with nontraumatic chest discomfort to hospital emergency departments in @ Oregon/Washington communities .
METHODS	The association between prepayment systems and EMS use was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression .
RESULTS	Overall EMS use was @ % ( n = @ ) .
RESULTS	Among EMS users , @ ( @ % ) were subsequently admitted to the hospital and @ ( @ % ) were released from the ED .
RESULTS	Prepayment was not associated with increased EMS use in the overall patient sample .
RESULTS	However , patients residing in low-income census block groups ( median annual income < $ @,@ ) were @ times ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] @ to @ ) more likely to use EMS when a prepayment system was available than when no system was present .
RESULTS	No association was noted among higher-income block group residents .
RESULTS	Among low-income block group residents lacking private insurance , prepayment systems were associated with @ times ( @ % CI @ to @ ) greater EMS usage .
CONCLUSIONS	Economic considerations may affect EMS system utilization among underinsured and low-income patients experiencing a cardiac event .
CONCLUSIONS	Prepayment systems may increase EMS utilization among these groups .

BACKGROUND	To investigate the influence of galantamine on linguistic function , any associated factors in patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia were analysed .
METHODS	@ patients younger than @ years with chronic aphasia ( @ year since onset ) were prospectively enrolled in the study .
METHODS	Language testing was performed at weeks @ and @ .
METHODS	Initial galantamine dose was @ mg/day for @ weeks , and @ mg/day for the following @ weeks .
METHODS	Efficacy was evaluated by the sum of four domains ( spontaneous speech , comprehension , repetition and naming ) on the aphasia quotient ( AQ ) of the Western Aphasia Battery from baseline ( AQ@ ) to endpoint ( AQ@ ) .
METHODS	Patients were considered as ` responding ' if the increase in AQ was @ .
RESULTS	Mean age was @ years ( @-@ ) and @ patients were female .
RESULTS	Mean duration of aphasia was @ years .
RESULTS	There was a significant increase in the total AQ score in the galantamine group ( n = @ , @-@ @ percentile ; p = @ ) but not in the control group ( n = @ , @-@ @ percentile ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The AQ@ score was independently associated with AQ@ , galantamine administration and Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score in multiple linear regression models .
RESULTS	With the galantamine group , the good responders ( vs poor responders ) had a higher level of education ( p = @ ) , higher baseline MMSE score ( p = @ ) and a subcortical dominant pattern ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjusting for potential variables , subcortical dominant lesion was the independent determinant for galantamine responsiveness ( OR @ ; @ % CI @ to @ , p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Administration of galantamine had a beneficial effect on chronic post-stroke aphasia , and was more prominent in subcortical dominant lesions .

###24329481
BACKGROUND	Gold-standard assessment of acute wound healing has traditionally been through histological analysis of biopsied tissue .
BACKGROUND	However , this process is invasive with recognized side-effects .
BACKGROUND	Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) is a noninvasive technique generating high-resolution real-time images of cutaneous architecture .
OBJECTIVE	To compare OCT with histological assessment of in vivo acute wound healing and ascertain the level of agreement between modalities for measurement of defined cutaneous structures .
METHODS	Punch biopsies ( @mm ) were harvested from @ healthy volunteers .
METHODS	Wounds healed by secondary intention until they were re-excised @ , @ , @ or @days later depending on random group allocation .
METHODS	Wounds were assessed weekly for @weeks using OCT and compared with histological findings derived from time-matched biopsies .
METHODS	Dimensions of four cutaneous structures were measured using both modalities and the level of agreement was established by Bland-Altman analysis .
METHODS	The mean greyscale value ( MGV ) of the upper reticular dermis was derived from OCT images at all time points .
RESULTS	Both techniques showed anatomical congruity in normal and wounded skin with correlating architectural changes associated with inflammatory , proliferative and remodelling wound healing phases .
RESULTS	MGV was significantly increased @weeks after wounding ( P = @ ) and may represent a novel measure of wound fibrosis .
RESULTS	Despite good association of histomorphometric values with low but consistent bias ( range -@ to @m ) , Bland-Altman plots demonstrated poor agreement between OCT and histology .
CONCLUSIONS	Optical coherence tomography enabled accurate assessment of healing tissue comparable with histological analysis of biopsy specimens .
CONCLUSIONS	This noninvasive tool is highly suited to wound assessment and may represent a diagnostic alternative to punch biopsies .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of the study were to investigate interindividual variations in the bioavailability of salmon calcitonin ( sCT ) following single oral @ mg doses at three different times of the day , and intraindividual variation in sCT bioavailability at each end of a @-day treatment period .
OBJECTIVE	We also investigated correlations between exposure to sCT and levels of the bone resorption biomarker serum C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I ( CTX-I ) .
METHODS	Participants were from two randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled studies .
METHODS	In study I , healthy postmenopausal women received a single dose of @ mg of oral sCT or placebo at @:@ ( n = @ ) , @:@ ( n = @ ) , or at @:@ ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	In study II , age-matched men or postmenopausal women with osteoarthritis received @ mg oral sCT ( n = @ ) or placebo ( n = @ ) twice daily for @ days , with dosing at @:@ and @:@ .
METHODS	In both studies , drug exposure was assessed by plasma sCT concentrations , and bone resorption by CTX-I levels .
RESULTS	The variability in exposure between patients , measured as coefficient of variation ( CV ) , was as follows : @ % for the morning dose , @ % for the predinner dose , and @ % for the evening dose .
RESULTS	In study @ , a high degree of correlation was seen between the level of exposure following a single @ mg dose of sCT and suppression of serum CTX-I , with Pearson correlation coefficients of r = -@ , -@ , and -@ , following doses at @:@ , @:@ , and @:@ , respectively .
RESULTS	In study II , exposure to sCT varied widely within the same individuals between dosing days @ and @ , with weak correlations of r = @ and @ at the dose times @:@ and @:@ , respectively .
RESULTS	As expected from this finding , the intraindividual response in serum CTX-I levels was non-significantly associated on dosing days @ and @ ( r = @ and r = @ at dose times @:@ and @:@ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Increased bioavailability of orally administered @ mg sCT was highly correlated with increased suppression of the bone resorption marker serum CTX-I irrespective of the time of day .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the high inter - and intraindividual variability in sCT exposure demonstrates the importance of determining the optimum conditions for ensuring the most beneficial sCT uptake .

OBJECTIVE	To determine if chymotrypsin-galactose ( CG ) treatment of sperm bound with antisperm antibodies ( ASA ) improves pregnancy rates ( PRs ) following in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) .
METHODS	Patients with > @ % ASA who failed to conceive despite six intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) cycles were included .
METHODS	Initially the sperm treatments were randomized with CG vs culture medium ; subsequently only CG treatment was used .
RESULTS	There was a significantly lower fertilization rate in those patients inseminated with sperm incubated in culture medium vs CG ( @ % vs @ % , P < @ t-test ) .
RESULTS	Similarly , a higher percentage of patients receiving culture medium treatment of sperm had failed fertilization ( @ % ) compared to CG ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Though the clinical PRs were higher with CG ( @ % ) tham medium ( @ % ) , there was no statistical difference .
CONCLUSIONS	Though the percentage of sperm bound with antibodies are not reduced , we hypothesize that the CG treatment improves fertility by possibly mitigating the antagonistic action of these antibodies .

OBJECTIVE	To test a new prescription counseling method termed `` patient-guided counseling '' ( PGC ) in community pharmacies .
METHODS	Post-test experimental design in which subjects were randomized to three groups .
METHODS	Six community pharmacies ( three chain and three independent ) .
METHODS	Patients presenting new prescriptions .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to one of three comparison groups .
METHODS	The PGC group was given a written prompt instructing them to write any questions they wished to ask about their prescription or their medical condition .
METHODS	The pharmacist then incorporated these questions into the subsequent verbal counseling .
METHODS	A second group was given a written prompt encouraging them to ask the pharmacist questions .
METHODS	This was followed by customary verbal counseling .
METHODS	A third group served as the control .
METHODS	No prompts were provided , but the pharmacist did provide customary verbal counseling .
METHODS	Patients ' demographics , recall of medication information , and satisfaction with counseling .
METHODS	Patients were contacted by telephone @ days after the start of drug therapy to measure compliance .
METHODS	Pharmacists rated their satisfaction with the information communicated and with their interactions with patients .
RESULTS	Compared with customary verbal counseling , the PGC method was associated with more supplemental questions asked by the patient .
RESULTS	Compared with the other two methods , PGC was associated with greater pharmacist satisfaction with the information communicated and slightly longer counseling sessions .
RESULTS	No significant differences were found for patients ' overall satisfaction with counseling , recall of information , and compliance .
CONCLUSIONS	In the community pharmacy setting , PGC fosters patient participation in medication counseling , a necessary element for the provision of pharmaceutical care .

BACKGROUND	Ear reconstruction is challenging surgery , often with poor outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Our purpose was to develop a surgical training model for auricular reconstruction .
METHODS	Silicone costal cartilage models were incorporated in a workshop-based instructional program .
METHODS	Trainees were randomly divided .
METHODS	Workshop group ( WG ) participated in an interactive session , carving frameworks under supervision .
METHODS	Nonworkshop group ( NWG ) did not participate .
METHODS	Standard Nagata templates were used .
METHODS	Two further frameworks were created , first with supervision then without .
METHODS	Groups were combined after the first carving because of frustration in the NWG .
METHODS	Assessment was completed by @ microtia surgeons from @ different centers , blinded to framework origin .
METHODS	Frameworks were rated out of @ using Likert and visual analog scales .
METHODS	Results were examined using SPSS ( version @ ) , with t test , ANOVA , and Bonferroni post hoc analyses .
RESULTS	Cartilaginous frameworks from the WG scored better for the first carving ( WG @ vs NWG @ ) , the NWG improved for the second carving ( WG @ vs NWG @ ) , and both groups scored lower with the third unsupervised carving ( WG @ vs NWG @ ) .
RESULTS	Combined scores after @ frameworks were not statistically significantly different between original groups .
RESULTS	A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated for all carvers between sessions @ and @ ( P @ ) , between sessions @ and @ ( P @ ) , but not between sessions @ and @ , thus suggesting the necessity of in vitro practice until high scores are achieved and maintained without supervision before embarking on in vivo carvings .
RESULTS	Quality of carvings was not related to level of training .
CONCLUSIONS	An appropriate and applicable surgical training model and training method can aid in attaining skills necessary for successful auricular reconstruction .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to compare ultrasonographic findings of the urethra and the tape position and mobility following the tension-free vaginal tape secure system ( TVT-S ) procedure and to correlate these data with clinical signs of cure and failure of this procedure in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) in women .
OBJECTIVE	Another aim of our study was to determine indications for particular position of the tape ( the `` hammock '' or `` U '' position ) based on ultrasonographic findings of the urethra and the tape position following TVT-S .
METHODS	Prospective , randomized study .
METHODS	Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics , First faculty of Medicine , Charles University and General Teaching Hospital , Prague .
METHODS	Analyses of the position of the urethra and the tape of @ patients were performed using perineal ultrasonography .
METHODS	The efficacy of the TVT-S procedure was evaluated by cough test and by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form ( ICIQ-UI SF ) .
RESULTS	Objective assessment by cough test showed that @ ( @ % ) of our patients were completely dry , and in @ ( @ % ) patients leakage of urine persisted after the operation .
RESULTS	From the US examination and results we can conclude that @ months after the operation the mobility of the urethra and bladder neck are restricted .
RESULTS	A correlation between cure effect and the restriction of the movement of the urethra was found between the position at the middle of the urethra before and after the operation .
RESULTS	Subjective assessment of the cure effect of this operation by the ICIQ-UI SF questionnaires ( n = @ ) showed that @ ( @ % ) of our patients were completely dry and @ ( @ % ) of patients improved , which means that in @ ( @ % ) patients leakage of urine persists after the operation .
RESULTS	There are differences in the restriction of urethral mobility between the cured patients and those where leakage persisted .
RESULTS	The middle of the urethra and UVJ are more restricted in movement in cured patients .
RESULTS	We found no statistically significant differences between the US measurements of the position of the urethra of patients with the tape in the `` hammock '' and the `` U '' position .
RESULTS	The only statistically significant difference found is a slightly higher tension of the `` U '' tape three months after the operation during the Valsalva maneuver ; the median width of the tape in the `` hammock '' position is @ mm , while in the `` U '' position it is @ ( Wilcoxon test p = @ ) .
RESULTS	There were six patients diagnosed with urgency de novo , without urge incontinence in this series .
RESULTS	In seven cases we found vaginal erosion .
CONCLUSIONS	From the US examination and results we can conclude that after the TVT-S operation , mobility of the urethra and bladder neck is restricted .
CONCLUSIONS	After comparing ultrasonographic findings of the urethra and the tape position following TVT - Secure we can determine that there is no certain indication for placement of the tape in the `` hammock '' or the `` U '' position .
CONCLUSIONS	The cure effect for different positions of the tape is similar .
CONCLUSIONS	In some respects the slightly higher tension of the tape in the `` U '' position suggests that this tape position may be preferred in patients with intrinsic sphincter defect ( ISD ) of the urethra .
CONCLUSIONS	A comparison of the cure effect of the TVT-S procedure with other tape procedures suggests a lower cure effect of this operation .

BACKGROUND	Some aspects of sublingual immunotherapy ( SLIT ) still need to be addressed : magnitude of the clinical efficacy , effect on the bronchial hyperreactivity adherence to treatment , preventive effect .
BACKGROUND	We attempted to clarify these points in a randomized open , controlled , two parallel group study in a real-life setting .
METHODS	Five hundred and eleven patients with allergic rhinitis with or without intermittent asthma were randomized to drugs only or drugs + SLIT ( rate @ : @ ) for @ years .
METHODS	The clinical score ( symptoms + drug intake ) was measured each year during the allergen exposure .
METHODS	Pulmonary function test , methacholine challenge and skin tests were performed at the beginning and at the end of the study .
METHODS	Adherence to treatment was assessed by measuring the consumed extract .
RESULTS	Three hundred and nineteen patients received SLIT and @ drugs only .
RESULTS	Dropouts were @ % in the SLIT group and @ % in the controls .
RESULTS	There was a significant improvement of clinical scores in the SLIT group : baseline @ + / - @ , first year @ + / - @ , second year @ + / - @ , third year @ + / - @ ( P < @ vs baseline ) .
METHODS	baseline @ + / - @ , first year @ + / - @ , second year @ + / - @ , third year @ + / - @ ( P = NS ) .
METHODS	Only four patients reported systemic itching .
METHODS	Adherence was > @ % in @ % and > @ % in @ % of patients .
METHODS	The number of patients with a positive MCh challenge decreased significantly after @ years only in the SLIT group .
METHODS	New skin sensitizations appeared in @ % of the controls and in @ % of the SLIT patients ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Sublingual immunotherapy approximately halved the clinical scores and significantly reduced the bronchial hyperreactivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Similarly to subcutaneous immunotherapy , SLIT displayed a preventive effect on the onset of new skin sensitizations .
CONCLUSIONS	The adherence rate was quantitatively satisfactory .

BACKGROUND	Few evidence-based weight loss treatment options exist for medically vulnerable patients in the primary care setting .
METHODS	We conducted a @-arm , @-month randomized effectiveness trial in @ Boston community health centers ( from February @ , @ , through May @ , @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were @ obese patients receiving hypertension treatment ( @ % black , @ % Hispanic , @ % female , and @ % with less than a high school educational level ) .
METHODS	We randomized participants to usual care or a behavioral intervention that promoted weight loss and hypertension self-management using eHealth components .
METHODS	The intervention included tailored behavior change goals , self-monitoring , and skills training , available via a website or interactive voice response ; @ telephone counseling calls ; primary care provider endorsement ; @ optional group support sessions ; and links with community resources .
RESULTS	At @ months , weight change in the intervention group compared with that in the usual care group was -@ kg ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ kg ) .
RESULTS	Twenty-four-month change in body mass index ( calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared ) in the intervention group compared with that in the usual care group was -@ ( @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) .
RESULTS	Intervention participants had larger mean weight losses during the @ months compared with that in the usual care group ( area under the receiver operating characteristic curve , -@ kg ; @ % CI , -@ to -@ ) .
RESULTS	Mean systolic blood pressure was not significantly lower in the intervention arm compared with the usual care arm .
CONCLUSIONS	The intervention produced modest weight losses , improved blood pressure control , and slowed systolic blood pressure increases in this high-risk , socioeconomically disadvantaged patient population .
CONCLUSIONS	Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT@ .

OBJECTIVE	Fesoterodine is a new , once-daily , oral , antimuscarinic agent indicated for the treatment of overactive bladder .
OBJECTIVE	It undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism by plasma esterases to form its principal active moiety , @-hydroxymethyl tolterodine ( @-HMT ) .
OBJECTIVE	The sustained-release formulation of fesoterodine delivers @-HMT with linear , dose-proportional pharmacokinetics ( PK ) suitable for once-daily dosing .
OBJECTIVE	This study was designed for the definitive assessment of the effect of food on @-HMT PK using the commercial formulation of fesoterodine .
METHODS	In this randomized , open-label , single-dose , @-way , crossover study , fesoterodine @ mg was administered orally to healthy subjects in either a fed ( after a high-fat , high-calorie breakfast ) or fasted state .
METHODS	Blood samples for PK were drawn up to @ hours after dosing .
METHODS	Primary endpoints for food effect assessment were area under the concentration-versus-time curve up to the last sample ( AUC ( @-tz ) ) , and maximum plasma concentration ( C ( max ) ) for @-HMT .
METHODS	Adverse events , vital signs , hematology , clinical chemistry , and electrocardiograms were monitored for safety assessment .
RESULTS	A total of @ healthy male subjects enrolled and completed the study .
RESULTS	Mean values of both primary PK parameters of @-HMT ( AUC ( @-tz ) and C ( max ) ) were approximately @ % higher after fesoterodine administration in the fed versus the fasted state .
RESULTS	The upper limits of the corresponding @ % confidence intervals for the `` fed/fasted '' ratios of AUC ( @-tz ) ( @ % , @ % ) and C ( max ) ( @ % , @ % ) were not included in the prespecified acceptance range ( @ % , @ % ) for concluding `` no food effect . ''
RESULTS	Secondary PK variables , ( i.e. time to maximum plasma concentration terminal elimination half-life and mean residence time ) , did not differ markedly between the fed and fasted states .
RESULTS	Fesoterodine was well tolerated , and adverse events were mild , with no apparent difference in frequency between fed and fasted states .
CONCLUSIONS	The hypothesis of `` no food effect '' could not be statistically confirmed ; however , only modest increases of approximately @ % were observed for C ( max ) and AUC ( @-tz ) of @-HMT .
CONCLUSIONS	This magnitude of PK effects is unlikely to be of clinical relevance based on Phase @ and @ clinical experience with fesoterodine , supporting its administration without regard to meals .

BACKGROUND	It has been ascertained that triple-negative ( TN ) breast cancer is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of our study was to compare the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) features of the @ major different breast cancer subtypes ( TN , luminal , and human epidermal growth factor receptor @ [ HER@ ] - overexpressing ) and to suggest the criteria that might predict TN phenotype .
METHODS	From October @ to April @ , we studied @ patients with histologically confirmed TN breast cancer who underwent breast MRI .
METHODS	We randomly included @ patients with non-TN breast cancer ( @ luminal and @ HER-overexpressing ) as a control group .
METHODS	We evaluated the clinicopathologic data , the MRI morphologic and kinetic features , the signal intensity on T@-weighted images , and the apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) .
RESULTS	Our results confirmed that TN tumors are more aggressive , are usually diagnosed at a younger age compared with the other study groups , and show benign morphologic features with MRI .
RESULTS	Backward stepwise logistic regression identified some parameters as independent predictors of TN-type lesions : age , size , shape , presence of edema , and infiltrative characteristics .
RESULTS	The receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve , built with @ of @ these factors as criteria to predict TN status , showed a @ area under the curve ( AUC ) value ( sensitivity @ % , specificity @ % ) .
RESULTS	The inclusion of the fifth criterion showed a @ AUC value ( sensitivity , @ % ; specificity , @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	We identified the clinicoradiologic parameters that are independent predictors of TN breast lesions , which might be helpful for earlier prediction of the TN status of a breast lesion .

METHODS	@ domestic shorthair cats ( @ males , @ females ) between @ and @ months old .
METHODS	Cats were randomly assigned to @ of @ eight-cat groups and experimentally infested with C. felis on days -@ , -@ , -@ , and -@ .
METHODS	On day @ , cats in the @ treatment groups were treated with an injectable formulation of lufenuron at doses of @ , @ , @ , or @ mg/kg of body weight , respectively .
METHODS	Control cats received the injectable formulation without lufenuron .
METHODS	Experimental infestations were repeated and flea eggs collected at various intervals for @ days after treatment .
METHODS	Eggs were placed in media and incubated in an insectary for @ days to determine effects of injectable lufenuron on egg and larval development .
METHODS	Number of adults that emerged from eggs were compared among groups .
RESULTS	Lufenuron injected once at a dose of @ or @ mg/kg , but not at @ or @ mg/kg , resulted in a @ % decrease in number of adult fleas emerging from eggs for @ days after treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Results indicate that control of flea egg and larval development for at least @ months can be achieved in cats with a single s.c. injection of lufenuron ( @ mg/kg ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The injectable formulation may provide veterinarians and cat owners an alternative to the tablet formulation of lufenuron .

BACKGROUND	There is a need for a simple and efficacious treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis with an acceptable side-effect profile .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , vehicle-controlled phase @ trial of topical treatments containing @ % paromomycin , with and without @ % gentamicin , for cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major in Tunisia .
METHODS	We randomly assigned @ patients with one to five ulcerative lesions from cutaneous leishmaniasis to receive a cream containing @ % paromomycin-@ @ % gentamicin ( called WR @,@ ) , @ % paromomycin alone , or vehicle control ( with the same base as the other two creams but containing neither paromomycin nor gentamicin ) .
METHODS	Each lesion was treated once daily for @ days .
METHODS	The primary end point was the cure of the index lesion .
METHODS	Cure was defined as at least @ % reduction in the size of the index lesion by @ days , complete reepithelialization by @ days , and absence of relapse by the end of the trial ( @ days ) .
METHODS	Any withdrawal from the trial was considered a treatment failure .
RESULTS	The rate of cure of the index lesion was @ % ( @ % confidence interval [ CI ] , @ to @ ) for paromomycin-gentamicin , @ % ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) for paromomycin alone , and @ % ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) for vehicle control ( P < @ for each treatment group vs. the vehicle-control group ) .
RESULTS	Cure of the index lesion was accompanied by cure of all other lesions except in five patients , one in each of the paromomycin groups and three in the vehicle-control group .
RESULTS	Mild-to-moderate application-site reactions were more frequent in the paromomycin groups than in the vehicle-control group .
CONCLUSIONS	This trial provides evidence of the efficacy of paromomycin-gentamicin and paromomycin alone for ulcerative L. major disease .

BACKGROUND	Chinese calligraphy handwriting is the practice of traditional Chinese brush writing , researches found calligraphy had therapeutic effects on certain diseases , some authors argued that calligraphy might have relaxation effect .
OBJECTIVE	This study was to compare the effects of calligraphy handwriting with those of progressive muscle relaxation and imagery training in Chinese Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma patients .
METHODS	This study was a randomized controlled trial .
METHODS	Two hundred and eighty-seven Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma patients were approached , ninety ( @ % ) patients were recruited and randomized to one of the three treatment groups : progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery training group , Calligraphy handwriting group , or a Control group .
METHODS	Seventy-nine ( @ % ) completed all of the outcome measures .
METHODS	The primary treatment outcome was the changes of physiological arousal parameters measured by pre - and post-treatment differences of heart rate , blood pressure and respiration rate .
METHODS	The secondary outcomes included : modified Chinese version of Symptom Distress Scale , Profile of Mood State-Short Form , and Karnofsky Performance Status measured at baseline , during treatment ( after the @-week intervention ) , post-treatment ( after the @-week intervention ) and after a @-week follow-up .
METHODS	Effectiveness was tested by repeated measure ANOVA analyses .
METHODS	Cancer centre of a major university hospital in Guangdong , China .
RESULTS	Results showed that both of calligraphy and relaxation training demonstrated slow-down effects on physiological arousal parameters .
RESULTS	Moreover , calligraphy practice gradually lowered participants ' systolic blood pressure ( simple main effect of time at pre-treatment measure , p = @ ) and respiration rate ( p = @ ) at pre - and post-treatment measures as the intervention proceeded , though with a smaller effect size as compared to relaxation .
RESULTS	Both of calligraphy and relaxation training had certain symptom relief and mood improvement effects in NPC patients .
RESULTS	Relaxation was effective in relieving symptom of insomnia ( p = @ ) and improving mood disturbance , calligraphy elevated level of concentration ( p = @ ) and improved mood disturbance .
CONCLUSIONS	Similar to the effects of relaxation training , calligraphy demonstrated a gradually build-up physiological slow-down , and associated with heightened concentration and improved mood disturbance .
CONCLUSIONS	Calligraphy offered a promising approach to improved health in cancer patients .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of early feeding after cesarean delivery under different anesthetic methods .
METHODS	Two hundred women with elective cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to early oral feeding ( EOF ) or routine oral feeding ( ROF ) groups .
METHODS	EOF patients were informed that they could begin taking fluids orally ( regime I ) as soon as @ hours after the delivery and then gradually progress to solid foods ( regime III ) , if tolerated .
METHODS	ROF patients were informed that they could start regime I right after bowel sounds were heard on examination and then gradually move on to regime III .
METHODS	Hospitalization time and total time to ambulation ( primary outcomes ) , gasstool discharge time and onset of bowel sounds ( secondary outcomes ) were compared in groups A [ EOF patients after regional anesthesia ( n = @ ) } , B [ EOF patients after general anesthesia ( n = @ ) } , C [ ROF patients after regional anesthesia ( n = @ ) } and @ [ ROF patients after general anesthesia ( n = @ ) ] .
RESULTS	There were significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between group A and the remaining groups , especially group D.
RESULTS	The status of patients from group B was not better than group C.
RESULTS	In fact , the latter were discharged home sooner and passage of gas , as well as initiation of regime I occurred earlier as compared to the former
CONCLUSIONS	Cesarean section under regional anesthesia and encouragement of oral feeding @ hours after the operation should be recommended in order to acnieve postoperative recovery and early hospital discharge .
CONCLUSIONS	Routine oral feeding ( right after bowel sounds are heard on examination ) after cesarean section under general anesthesia should be the last choice .

OBJECTIVE	To describe the methodology of evaluating the response of cancer patients to interventions directed at lowering severity of multiple symptoms , and to compare two arms of a symptom management trial to determine factors associated with response and time to response .
METHODS	Randomized trial comparing a nurse-assisted symptom management ( NASM ) cognitive-behavioral intervention with an automated telephone symptom management ( ATSM ) .
METHODS	Patients in both arms received six intervention contacts over @ weeks .
METHODS	Analyses of the intervention contact data for @ patients in NASM arm and @ patients in the ATSM arm were conducted .
METHODS	Severities of @ cancer-related symptoms were assessed at each intervention contact , and an anchor-based definition of response was adopted .
METHODS	Analyses were carried out using generalized estimating equations and Cox marginal proportional hazard models .
RESULTS	When compared with patients in the NASM , patients in the ATSM had better response to manage anxiety , depression , poor appetite , cough , and fatigue .
RESULTS	NASM was more successful in managing cancer pain .
RESULTS	Response and time to response were associated with several patient and disease characteristics .
CONCLUSIONS	The approach described here presents an analytic and clinical improvement over methods that examine each symptom separately or use summed scores of severity .

BACKGROUND	In vitro fertilization , sometimes involving the cryopreservation of human embryos , has become a routine procedure for the treatment of infertility .
BACKGROUND	Even though there are embryos available for transfer in about @ percent of the treatment cycles , the rate of pregnancy rarely exceeds @ percent per cycle .
BACKGROUND	We designed this study to investigate two questions : Does this high rate of failure result from inadequate technique , or does it simply reflect the maximal potential of a cohort of aspirated eggs to produce a pregnancy ?
BACKGROUND	And to what extent does cryopreservation affect the capacity for implantation of embryos ?
METHODS	The study was conducted among patients enrolled in an egg-donation program .
METHODS	Aspirated eggs from a given cohort were distributed to the donor herself and a few recipients .
METHODS	The recipients were prepared by a standard protocol of hormone replacement and were assigned at random to the transfer of either fresh or frozen and thawed embryos .
METHODS	The donors received only fresh embryos .
RESULTS	Forty cycles of donation were studied .
RESULTS	In @ cycles ( @ percent ) pregnancy was established in the donor , in the recipient ( or recipients ) , or in both .
RESULTS	Of the fresh embryos that were transferred to the recipients , @ percent were successfully implanted , as compared with only @ percent of the frozen and thawed embryos ( P less than @ ) .
RESULTS	A pregnancy success rate of @ percent per recipient cycle was observed in the recipients of fresh embryos , as compared with a rate of only @ percent in those receiving frozen and thawed embryos ( P less than @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The majority of egg cohorts evidently possess the potential to produce a pregnancy , but cryopreservation of human embryos significantly reduces their capacity for implantation .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effect of mosapride , a selective @-hydroxytryptamine-@ agonist , on esophageal motility and bolus transit in asymptomatic volunteers .
METHODS	Twenty healthy subjects participated in two experiments , @ days apart , and we utilized a randomized , double-blind cross-over design with @-day pretreatments of placebo or mosapride .
METHODS	All subjects underwent combined intraluminal impedance manometry .
RESULTS	There was no difference in the amplitude , the duration , and the esophageal peristaltic patterns between the two pretreatments .
RESULTS	The lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) pressure and the number of transient LES relaxations did not change after mosapride vs. placebo .
RESULTS	However , the rate of complete bolus transit in liquid swallows was higher with mosapride pretreatment ( @ % ) than with placebo ( @ % ; P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The total bolus transit time in all liquid swallows showed a tendency to shorten after mosapride treatment ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The liquid bolus transit became faster after mosapride , especially in manometrically ineffective liquid swallows ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The total bolus transit time for manometrically normal viscous swallows decreased after pretreatment with mosapride ( @ seconds ; range , @-@ @ ) in comparison with placebo ( @ seconds ; range , @-@ @ ; P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Mosapride increases the rate of complete bolus transit in the esophagus , and enhances esophageal bolus transit in asymptomatic volunteers .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the efficacy of combination therapy with sustained-release diltiazem and hydrochlorothiazide ( DTZ SR-HCTZ ) with that of monotherapy with DTZ SR , HCTZ , or placebo in the treatment of essential hypertension ; and to determine whether the addition of a diuretic to diltiazem at apparent optimum doses of each agent significantly enhances their antihypertensive effects .
METHODS	Multicenter , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trial with a @-week treatment phase .
METHODS	Private and university-based clinics .
METHODS	Subjects of either sex , ranging in age from @-@ years , with a diagnosis of stable essential hypertension made from two consecutive weekly mean supine diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) readings of @ mm Hg or above to @ mm Hg or less that varied @ mm Hg or less after @-@ weeks in the baseline phase .
METHODS	Of the patients enrolled , @ met the inclusion criteria .
METHODS	Combination therapy with DTZ SR-HCTZ @ mg-@ @ mg , or monotherapy with DTZ SR @ mg or HCTZ @ mg , or placebo was administered twice daily .
RESULTS	Combination therapy with DTZ SR-HCTZ lowered both supine DBP and SBP significantly ( p < @ ) more than either single agent .
RESULTS	The combination also lowered DBP and SBP significantly more than either monotherapy .
RESULTS	During a @-hour in-clinic monitoring period spanning a dosing interval , both the combination and DTZ SR therapies maintained efficacy , whereas the antihypertensive effects of HCTZ dissipated after @ hours .
RESULTS	Treatment-related adverse events for the combination and HCTZ were similar but slightly greater than those for DTZ SR and placebo .
CONCLUSIONS	The addition of a diuretic to sustained-release diltiazem produced an enhanced antihypertensive effect compared with monotherapy with either individual agent .

BACKGROUND	The Surgical Management of Arterial Revascularization Therapies trial was conceived to rigorously compare completeness of revascularization , clinical outcomes and resource utilization in unselected patients referred for elective , primary coronary artery bypass grafting randomly assigned to undergo off-pump ( OPCAB ) or conventional on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting using cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .
BACKGROUND	The goal of this follow-up study was to compare long-term survival , graft patency , myocardial ischemia , and clinical outcomes among survivors who volunteered to return for clinical evaluation and imaging studies .
METHODS	Two hundred unselected patients with multivessel coronary artery disease were randomly assigned to OPCAB or CPB coronary artery bypass grafting between March @ and August @ .
METHODS	All-cause mortality was determined by individual patient contact and referencing the Social Security Death Master File .
METHODS	Of @ survivors , @ volunteered to return after a minimum of @ years ( maximum , @ years ; mean , @ years ) for assessment of graft patency ( computed tomographic angiography ) and myocardial ischemia ( cardiac positron emission tomography and @-lead electrocardiogram ) .
METHODS	Age at follow-up ranged from @ to @ years ( mean , @ years ) .
RESULTS	There were @ deaths from all causes among OPCAB patients and @ among CPB patients as of March @ , @ .
RESULTS	Graft patency was similar between groups among @ grafts assessed by angiography before hospital discharge ( @ % OPCAB versus @ % CPB ; p = @ , Fisher 's exact test ) , among @ grafts assessed by angiography at @ year ( @ % OPCAB versus @ % CPB ; p = @ ) , and among @ grafts assessed by computed tomographic angiography at late follow-up ( @ % OPCAB versus @ % CPB ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Twelve of @ OPCAB ( @ % ) and @ of @ CPB patients ( @ % ) had any ischemia on positron emission tomography scanning ( p = @ ) .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the effect of phytoestrogens on bone turnover and growth in adolescent boys .
METHODS	Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Single school in northwest Tasmania .
METHODS	Adolescent boys ( treatment n = @ , placebo n = @ , mean age @ y ) .
METHODS	Six weeks of isoflavone supplementation ( Novasoy , @ mg daily of isoflavone equivalents ) .
METHODS	Bone turnover markers ( bone specific alkaline phosphatase ( BAP ) and pyridinoline creatinine ratio ( PYR ) ) were measured at baseline and follow-up .
RESULTS	Despite marked increases in urinary genistein and daidzein in the treatment arm ( both P < @ ) , there were no significant differences in BAP , PYR or short-term height or weight change .
RESULTS	This applied to both intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis .
RESULTS	Neither was there a significant correlation between urinary genistein and daidzein levels and BAP or PYR .
CONCLUSIONS	Phytoestrogen supplementation to the level of usual Japanese dietary intake has no measurable effect on bone turnover in adolescent boys .
CONCLUSIONS	Longer-term studies of bone density may be desirable but it is unlikely that there will be a large effect in either girls or boys given the lower endogenous oestrogen levels in boys .

OBJECTIVE	The present study tested the hypothesis that human choroidal blood flow ( ChBF ) regulation in the face of changes in ocular perfusion pressure ( OPP ) may be modified by a drug-induced decrease in intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .
METHODS	This hypothesis was tested in a double-masked , randomized , placebo-controlled , parallel-group trial in @ healthy volunteers .
METHODS	OPP was manipulated by @ minutes of squatting and a subsequent period of artificial increase in IOP induced with a suction cup .
METHODS	These interventions were repeated after @ days of treatment with either latanoprost or placebo .
METHODS	ChBF was measured continuously with a portable laser Doppler flowmeter .
RESULTS	As expected , latanoprost significantly reduced IOP compared with placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The relative increases in OPP during squatting ( P = @ ) and an artificial IOP increase ( P = @ ) , however , were comparable after placebo and latanoprost .
RESULTS	The response of ChBF was , in contrast , different between the two treatment groups .
RESULTS	During the squatting-induced elevation of OPP , ChBF increased less after latanoprost than after placebo treatment ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	During the suction cup-induced increase in IOP , the decrease in ChBF was less pronounced after latanoprost than after placebo ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Latanoprost , however , did not modify baseline ChBF at rest ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The data indicate that latanoprost improves ChBF regulation during both an increase and a decrease in OPP .
CONCLUSIONS	Since latanoprost did not affect baseline ChBF , the authors assume that this effect is related to the decrease in IOP .
CONCLUSIONS	This finding has important implications for understanding the relation between IOP and vascular factors in glaucoma , because it indicates that a reduction in IOP itself improves ChBF regulation .

OBJECTIVE	Tourniquet-related nerve injuries remain a concern in orthopedic surgery .
OBJECTIVE	The cuff pressures used today are generally lower , and therefore a decreasing incidence of peripheral nerve injuries might also be expected .
OBJECTIVE	However , there have been few neurophysiological studies describing the outcome after bloodless field surgery .
OBJECTIVE	We describe the results of neurophysiological examinations and report the incidence of nerve injuries after total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) in a bloodless field .
METHODS	This study was part of a prospective , randomized controlled clinical trial in patients scheduled for TKA in a bloodless field .
METHODS	@ consecutive patients were enrolled .
METHODS	Electroneurography ( ENeG ) and quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) of thermal thresholds were performed on day @ .
METHODS	These tests were repeated @ months after surgery when electromyography ( EMG ) with a concentric-needle electrode was also performed .
RESULTS	The mean tourniquet cuff pressure was @ ( SD @ ) mmHg .
RESULTS	Electromyographic signs of denervation were found in @ patient , who also had the highest cuff pressure in the study population ( @ mmHg ) .
RESULTS	The sensory nerve response amplitudes were lower in the operated leg on day @ ; otherwise , the neurophysiological examinations showed no differences between the legs .
CONCLUSIONS	When low tourniquet cuff pressures are used the risk of nerve injury is minor .

OBJECTIVE	The PROACT II study demonstrated a significant benefit from treatment with intra-arterial pro-urokinase ( r-proUK ) in patients with middle cerebral artery occlusion treated within @ hours of stroke onset .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the current study was to examine baseline factors to determine predictors of good outcome and response to treatment .
METHODS	We selected from the baseline clinical , radiologic , and angiographic data variables that considered possibly related to outcome .
METHODS	A univariate analysis was performed to examine the association between these baseline factors and good outcome , defined as a modified Rankin scale score < or = @ .
METHODS	A multivariate model then selected the most important variables independently influencing prognosis .
METHODS	A risk score for each patient was constructed on the basis of the patient 's individual values for each independent variable .
METHODS	Patients were stratified into risk quartiles based on their risk scores , and an odds ratio for each risk quartile was calculated .
METHODS	The treatment effects of each quartile were compared .
RESULTS	In the univariate analysis , screening National Institutes of Health stroke scale ( NIHSS ) score and age were strongly associated with good outcome .
RESULTS	The multivariate model selected age , NIHSS score , and CT hypodensity as the most important prognostic variables .
RESULTS	Dividing patients into quartiles based on risk scores achieved a uniform gradient of probability of good outcomes .
RESULTS	A trend toward benefit of r-proUK treatment was seen in all risk quartiles , and no differential treatment effect was observed across risk groups .
CONCLUSIONS	There was no evidence of differential effect of r-proUK across subgroups of patients stratified by risk .

OBJECTIVE	To determine the effects of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) and transcutaneous spinal electroanalgesia ( TSE ) on mechanical pain threshold ( MPT ) and vibration threshold ( VT ) .
METHODS	A prospective , single-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled trial .
METHODS	Laboratory based .
METHODS	Thirty-four healthy volunteers ( @ men and @ women ; mean age + / - standard deviation @ + / -@ years ) .
METHODS	Exclusion criteria were conditions affecting upper limb sensation and contraindications to electrical stimulation .
METHODS	Participants were allocated at random to receive TENS ( n = @ ) , TSE ( n = @ ) , placebo ( n = @ ) or control ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Electrical stimulation was applied for @ minutes ( from time @ minutes to @ minutes ) via electrodes ( @ cmx@ cm ) placed centrally above and below the space between the C@ and C@ spinous processes , with @ cm between electrodes .
METHODS	MPT ( using an algometer ) and VT ( using a vibrameter ) were recorded on seven occasions from the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the right hand - at baseline ( @ minutes ) and then at @-minute intervals until the end of the @-minute testing period .
RESULTS	There were no statistically significant group differences in MPT ( all p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Significant group differences in VT were found at @ , @ and @ minutes ( all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Post-hoc tests showed that the TENS group had significantly greater VT than both the placebo [ median difference @ microm , @ % confidence interval ( CI ) -@ to @ ] and control ( @ microm , @ % CI @ to @ ) groups at @ minutes , and significantly greater VT than the control group ( @ microm , @ % CI @ to @ ) at @ minutes ( all p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Electrical stimulation did not alter MPT .
CONCLUSIONS	The increase in VT during TENS may be due to distraction or antidromic block of large-diameter nerve fibres .
CONCLUSIONS	TSE failed to alter either outcome measure significantly .

BACKGROUND	One criticism of current video systems for endoscopic surgery is that two-dimensional ( @D ) images lack depth perception and may impair surgical dissection .
BACKGROUND	To objectively measure the efficacy of @D endoscopy , we designed a training model with specific tasks to show potential differences between @D and @D endoscopy .
BACKGROUND	Its clinical value was then evaluated during endoscopic sinus and skull base surgical cases .
METHODS	Fifteen subjects were grouped according to endoscopic experience : novices and nonnovices .
METHODS	A training model was constructed to include five tasks : incision manipulation ; ring transfer ; nerve hook ; distance estimation , visual only ; and distance estimation , visual and tactile .
METHODS	Each participant was assessed with both a standard @D endoscope and a @D endoscope .
METHODS	The clinical value of a @D endoscope ( Visionsense , Ltd. , Petach Tikva , Israel ) was then examined in four endoscopic sinus cases and four skull base cases .
RESULTS	Of the subjects , six ( @ % ) were novices .
RESULTS	Overall , the errors committed during any one task were not significantly different between systems .
RESULTS	Novices trended toward more success during the nerve hook task using the @D system .
RESULTS	With size cueing versus visualization alone , distance estimation was significantly more accurate .
RESULTS	Novices tended to prefer the @D system and experienced surgeons disliked the initial learning curve .
RESULTS	Advantages were particularly noticed during skull base surgery ; subjectively improved depth perception was beneficial during vascular dissection .
CONCLUSIONS	Three-dimensional endoscopy may improve depth perception and performance for novices .
CONCLUSIONS	The @D endoscope is a safe and feasible tool for endoscopic sinus and skull base surgery ; it is promising for improving microneurosurgical dissection precision transnasally .

BACKGROUND	Dissolution process in oral liquids by the presence of glass-ionomer systems ( due to surface corrosion , to diffusion through solutions and through mass ) make an ionic release ( particularly F , Al , Pb , As ) which is a non secondary problem , due to the usual utilization of these materials in pedodontic and restorative dentistry .
METHODS	In this work , considering the high toxicity of low quantity of Arsenic ion , a comparative research has been made in order to determine , by using high level liquid Cromatography ( HPCL ) , the quantity in ppm of As hydro - and acid soluble given by five ionomeric products , in water and in nitric acid concentrated solution .
CONCLUSIONS	The results show that in some products arsenical concentrations are higher then the quantity accepted by ISO-FDI ; therefore , a better control in the production of these products is needed as well as a limited use in dentistry .
CONCLUSIONS	It is suggested to use glass-ionomer systems in patients with dental dike and varnish on the surfaces that are in contact with oral liquids action .

OBJECTIVE	Globotriaosylceramide concentrations were assessed as potential predictors of change from baseline after @ months by estimated glomerular filtration rate and left-ventricular mass index using pooled data from three randomized , placebo-controlled agalsidase alfa trials and open-label extensions of patients with Fabry disease .
METHODS	Males ( aged @ years or older ) with Fabry disease received agalsidase alfa ( @ mg/kg every other week for @ months ) .
METHODS	A backward-elimination approach evaluated potential predictors ( baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and left-ventricular mass index ; age at first dose ; baseline and change from baseline at @ months of globotriaosylceramide ( urine , plasma ) ; urine protein excretion ; and systolic and diastolic blood pressure ) .
METHODS	Subgroups included patients randomized to placebo or agalsidase alfa ( double-blind phase ) , then to agalsidase alfa ( open-label extensions ; placeboagalsidase alfa or agalsidase alfaagalsidase alfa , respectively ) and stage @/@ chronic kidney disease patients .
RESULTS	Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate , age at first dose , baseline urine globotriaosylceramide excretion , and baseline and change from baseline urine protein excretion significantly predicted change from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate in the analysis population ( N = @ ; all P < @ ) , although not in all subgroups .
RESULTS	Change from baseline urine and plasma globotriaosylceramide ( baseline and change from baseline ) concentrations did not predict change from baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate .
RESULTS	No predictors of left-ventricular mass index were significant .
CONCLUSIONS	Changes in globotriaosylceramide concentrations do not appear to be useful biomarkers for prediction of Fabry disease-related changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate or left-ventricular mass index .

OBJECTIVE	Equol , a gut bacterial metabolite of the isoflavone daidzein , has been associated with beneficial health effects .
OBJECTIVE	Recent studies indicate that women with intestinal capacity to convert daidzein to equol also have the capacity to alter steroid metabolism and bioavailability of estrogens .
METHODS	We evaluated whether individual equol production capability , while not consuming soy supplement , was associated with lower blood pressure in postmenopausal women using tibolone .
METHODS	In addition , in a randomized , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial we assessed the effect of soy supplementation on blood pressure in both equol-producing ( n = @ ) and non-equol-producing ( n = @ ) women using tibolone .
METHODS	Blood pressure was recorded with a validated oscillometric technique .
RESULTS	The circulating equol levels rose @-fold in the equol producers and @-fold in the non-equol producers .
RESULTS	At baseline , systolic blood pressure ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ mmHg , p = @ ) , diastolic blood pressure ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ mmHg , p = @ ) and mean arterial blood pressure ( @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ mmHg , p = @ ) were lower in equol producers compared to non-equol producers .
RESULTS	Soy supplementation had no effect on blood pressure in either group , whereas the baseline differences persisted .
CONCLUSIONS	Postmenopausal women using tibolone characterized as equol producers had lower blood pressure compared to non-equol producers .
CONCLUSIONS	Soy supplementation for @ months had no blood pressure-lowering effect .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the effects of an expressive writing intervention ( EWI ) on cancer-related distress , depressive symptoms , and mood in women treated for early stage breast cancer .
METHODS	A nationwide sample of @ Danish women who had recently completed treatment for primary breast cancer were randomly assigned to three @-min home-based writing exercises , one week apart , focusing on either emotional disclosure ( EWI group ) or a non-emotional topic ( control group ) .
METHODS	Cancer-related distress [ Impact of Event Scale ( IES ) ] , depressive symptoms ( Beck Depression Inventory-Short Form ) , and negative ( @-item Profile of Moods State ) and positive mood ( Passive Positive Mood Scale ) were assessed at baseline and at @ and @ months post-intervention .
METHODS	Choice of writing topic ( cancer versus other ) , alexithymia ( @-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ) , and social constraints ( Social Constraints Scale ) were included as possible moderators .
RESULTS	Significant ( p < @ ) group differences in mood change from before to immediately after each session suggested successful manipulation .
RESULTS	Reductions over time in psychological symptoms were seen in both groups ( p < @ ) , but no time group interactions were found .
RESULTS	Choice of writing topic moderated effects on IES , with women writing about other themes showing greater reductions in cancer-related avoidance than women writing about their cancer .
RESULTS	Fewer depressive symptoms and higher levels of positive mood were seen @ months post-intervention in women writing about their cancer when compared with the control group .
RESULTS	Difficulties describing feelings and externally oriented thinking ( @-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale ) moderated effects on positive mood and IES-total , while no moderating effects were found of social constraints .
CONCLUSIONS	In concordance with the majority of previous results with cancer patients , no main effects of EWI were found for cancer-related distress , depressive symptoms , and mood .
CONCLUSIONS	Moderator analyses suggested that choice of writing topic and ability to process emotional experiences should be studied further .

BACKGROUND	Procalcitonin ( PCT ) is a thyroid gland prohormone , and its serum concentration is elevated in systemic bacterial infections .
BACKGROUND	The diagnostic cut-off value of PCT in patients early after cardiac surgery remains unclear .
OBJECTIVE	We investigated whether procalcitonin-guidance could reduce antibiotic usage safely .
METHODS	The prospective study included @ patients who underwent open heart surgery .
METHODS	The patients were randomly assigned for procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment ( PCT-group ; n = @ ) or standard care ( standard group ; n = @ ) .
METHODS	On the basis of serum procalcitonin concentrations , usage of antibiotics was encouraged ( PCT > or = @ ng/mL ) or discouraged .
RESULTS	A relative risk of antibiotic exposure in the standard group compared with the PCT-group was @ ( @ % CI = @-@ @ ; p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mean cost of antibiotics per patient in procalcitonin group was Euro @ + / - @ vs. Euro @ + / - @ ( p = @ ) in the standard group , while the mean cost per hospital day was Euro @ + / - @ vs. Euro @ + / - @ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	We found that non-infectious complications occurred in @/@ vs. @/@ ( p = @ ) while infections appeared in @/@ vs. @/@ ( p = @ ) cases .
RESULTS	A statistically significant difference was observed in the treatment of urinary infections between PCT-group and standard group ; @/@ vs. @/@ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the PCT-group , the ICU stay was @ + / - @ days and in the standard group @ + / - @ ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The hospital stay was @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ ( p > @ ) days , respectively .
RESULTS	Mortality rates were equal in both groups of patients ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic treatment is safe and can significantly reduce the cost of postoperative care .
CONCLUSIONS	Additionally , the antibiotic use during immediate postoperative course should be timely controlled and limited to documented bacterial infections .

RESULTS	No difference between membranes was observed for serum albumin , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , IL-@ , triglycerides , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , and lipoprotein ( a ) during the study .
RESULTS	A significant increase in aortic PWV , a marker of aortic stiffness , was noted after patients switched from high-flux to low-flux polyamide membranes .
RESULTS	Similarly , the rate of change in aortic PWV was significantly decreased with the use of the high-flux polyamide membrane .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings suggest that dialysis with polyamide membranes with different flux characteristics did not modify the inflammatory indices and lipid profile in stable HD patients ; however , a seemingly beneficial effect on aortic stiffness was noted for patients who were maintained on high-flux polyamide membrane .

OBJECTIVE	Measurements of the integrity of knee ligaments are used to diagnose injuries as well as to document the state of recovery .
OBJECTIVE	Many factors , such as gender and experience of the examiner , are capable of influencing the reliability of such measurements .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects on interrater reliability of measurements obtained using the KT-@ arthrometer of experience , gender , and leg tested .
METHODS	Two experienced examiners ( @ male , @ female ) and two inexperienced examiners ( @ male , @ female ) tested @ subjects with unilateral anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) pathology .
METHODS	The leg with an ACL injury and the uninjured leg of each subject were evaluated by all four examiners within one test session using @-N , @-N , maximum manual , and active anterior drawer tests .
RESULTS	Greater anterior displacement values were found in the legs with ACL injury than in the uninjured legs .
RESULTS	Reliability estimates , as assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients ( @ , k ) and measurement error ( SEM ) , suggest that therapist experience may be a more important factor influencing reliability than gender .
CONCLUSIONS	Given the magnitude of the errors obtained for tests routinely conducted in the clinic using the KT-@ arthrometer , we recommend that repeated measurements should be taken by the same examiners whenever possible .
CONCLUSIONS	[ Ballantyne BT , French AK , Heimsoth SL , et al. .
CONCLUSIONS	Influence of examiner experience and gender on interrater reliability of KT-@ arthrometer measurements .

OBJECTIVE	The aims of this study were to validate a randomized , split-mouth , localized experimental gingivitis model and to identify subjects with different gingivitis susceptibility .
METHODS	In each of @ healthy subjects , one maxillary quadrant was randomly assigned as `` test '' ( experimental gingivitis ) and the contralateral quadrant as `` control '' .
METHODS	Plaque index ( PlI ) , gingival index ( GI ) , gingival crevicular fluid volume ( GCF ) , and angulated bleeding score ( AngBS ) were recorded in both quadrants at days @ , @ , @ , and @ .
METHODS	Cumulative plaque exposure ( CPE ) , i.e. PlI over time , was calculated .
METHODS	Day-@ GCF was standardized according to CPE , and residuals of GCF on CPE were calculated .
METHODS	Two subpopulations were then defined , based on upper and lower quartiles of GCF-residual distribution and were , respectively , identified as `` high-responder '' ( HR ; n = @ ) and `` low-responder '' ( LR ; n = @ ) .
RESULTS	At test quadrants , all parameters significantly increased throughout the trial , while in control quadrants , PlI , GI , and AngBS remained low .
RESULTS	Significant differences were noted between test and control quadrants on days @ , @ , and @ for all parameters .
RESULTS	Significant increases in GI , AngBS , and GCF were observed in test quadrants over the course of the study in both HR and LR groups .
RESULTS	Significant differences were noted between HR and LR groups for all gingivitis parameters on day @ in test quadrants , without any significant differences in PlI or CPE between the groups .
CONCLUSIONS	We identified two subpopulations characterized by significant differences in clinical parameters of plaque-induced gingival inflammation , despite similar amounts of plaque deposits and plaque accumulation rates .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study was to determine patient characteristics that are a priori predictors of early infarct related artery patency following thrombolytic therapy , and to provide a paradigm which may identify patients who would be most likely to achieve restoration of normal ( TIMI @ ) coronary flow in response to thrombolytic therapy .
BACKGROUND	Restoration of infarct-related artery perfusion in acute myocardial infarction is necessary for preservation of ventricular function and mortality reduction .
BACKGROUND	Clinical variables that are a priori predictors of early patency with currently available thrombolytic regimens have not been fully characterized .
METHODS	The probability of early infarct-related artery patency ( TIMI @ flow ) was determined by multivariable logistic regression .
METHODS	We determined a reduced ( parsimonious ) model for predicting early ( @ min ) infarct-related artery patency ( TIMI grade @ ) based on data from @,@ patients in the GUSTO-I Angiographic study .
RESULTS	Predictors of @ min TIMI @ flow are use of an accelerated t-PA regimen ( vs. streptokinase containing regimens ) ( chi@ = @ ; p < or = @ ) , infarct related artery ( RCA/Lcx vs. LAD ) ( chi@ = @ ; p = @ ) , body weight ( chi@ = @ ; p = @ ) and history of smoking ( chi@ = @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Time from symptom onset to treatment was not significant ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The efficacy of currently available thrombolytic regimens is chiefly dependent on choice of thrombolytic regimen , body weight , infarct-related coronary artery and smoking history .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical variables alone correctly predict a priori TIMI @ flow in the infarct-related artery @ % of the time .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with body weights greater than @ kg are at a significant disadvantage with regard to achieving successful thrombolysis compared to those with lesser body weights .

BACKGROUND	The multicenter PROTECT AF study ( Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation ) was conducted to determine whether percutaneous left atrial appendage closure with a filter device ( Watchman ) was noninferior to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation .
RESULTS	Patients ( n = @ ) with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and at least @ risk factor ( age > @ years , hypertension , heart failure , diabetes , or prior stroke/transient ischemic attack ) were randomized to either the Watchman device ( n = @ ) or continued warfarin ( n = @ ) in a @:@ ratio .
RESULTS	After device implantation , warfarin was continued for @ days , followed by clopidogrel for @ months and lifelong aspirin .
RESULTS	Study discontinuation rates were @ % ( @/@ ) and @ % ( @/@ ) for the Watchman and warfarin groups , respectively .
RESULTS	The time in therapeutic range for the warfarin group was @ % .
RESULTS	The composite primary efficacy end point included stroke , systemic embolism , and cardiovascular death , and the primary analysis was by intention to treat .
RESULTS	After @ patient-years of follow-up ( mean @ years ) , the primary efficacy event rates were @ % and @ % ( percent per @ patient-years ) in the Watchman and warfarin groups , respectively ( relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @ % -@ % per year ) , which met the criteria for noninferiority ( probability of noninferiority > @ ) .
RESULTS	There were more primary safety events in the Watchman group ( @ % per year ; @ % confidence interval , @ % -@ % per year ) than in the control group ( @ % per year ; @ % confidence interval , @ % -@ % per year ; relative risk , @ ; @ % confidence interval , @-@ @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The `` local '' strategy of left atrial appendage closure is noninferior to `` systemic '' anticoagulation with warfarin .
CONCLUSIONS	PROTECT AF has , for the first time , implicated the left atrial appendage in the pathogenesis of stroke in atrial fibrillation .

BACKGROUND	Modern medical imaging modalities can trace labelled oral drug dosage forms in the gastrointestinal tract , and thus represent important tools for the evaluation of their in vivo performance .
BACKGROUND	The application of gastric-retentive drug delivery systems to improve bioavailability and to avoid unwanted plasma peak concentrations of orally administered drugs is of special interest in clinical and pharmaceutical research .
OBJECTIVE	To determine the influence of meal composition and timing of tablet administration on the intragastric performance of a gastric-retentive floating tablet using magnetic resonance imaging in the sitting position .
METHODS	A tablet formulation was labelled with iron oxide particles as negative magnetic resonance contrast marker to allow the monitoring of the tablet position in the food-filled human stomach .
METHODS	Labelled tablet was administered , together with three different solid meals , to volunteers seated in a @-T open-configuration magnetic resonance system .
METHODS	Volunteers were followed over a @-h period .
RESULTS	Labelled tablet was detectable in all subjects throughout the entire study .
RESULTS	The tablet showed persistent good intragastric floating performance independent of meal composition .
RESULTS	Unfavourable timing of tablet administration had a minor effect on the intragastric tablet residence time and floating performance .
CONCLUSIONS	Magnetic resonance imaging can reliably monitor and analyse the in vivo performance of labelled gastric-retentive tablets in the human stomach .

BACKGROUND	Mild cognitive impairments have been recorded in cross-sectional studies of women with breast cancer receiving endocrine treatment .
BACKGROUND	More comprehensive studies were warranted because aromatase inhibitors are being used increasingly in both chemoprevention and adjuvant settings .
BACKGROUND	We report findings from the cognitive subprotocol of the International Breast Intervention Study ( IBIS II ) , a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of anastrozole in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to study and compare the effect of anastrozole versus placebo on memory and attention in these women .
METHODS	Between Jan @ , @ , and Dec @ , @ , participants were recruited into the cognitive subprotocol from five UK centres .
METHODS	Cognitive assessments were done before randomisation , at @ months , and at @ months .
METHODS	@ of @ women approached completed a comprehensive set of standardised cognitive tasks at baseline and were randomly assigned to receive anastrozole ( @ mg/day for @ years ) or placebo .
METHODS	Psychological morbidity , endocrine symptoms , and self-reported cognitive complaints were also measured .
METHODS	The main outcomes were cognitive task scores at baseline , @ months , and @ months .
METHODS	Analyses were done by intention to treat .
METHODS	This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial , number ISRCTN@ .
RESULTS	@ women were assigned to anastrozole and @ women to placebo .
RESULTS	At @ months , ten women in each group were excluded from analysis , leaving a total of @ of @ ( @ % ) women available for further assessments .
RESULTS	At @ months , @ women were excluded from the anastrozole group and @ from the placebo group , leaving @ of @ ( @ % ) women .
RESULTS	We did not note any significant differences between the groups for any of the cognitive tasks .
RESULTS	By @ months , @ women in both groups reported changes to their memory and this had decreased to five women in the placebo group and three women in the anastrozole group by the @-month assessment .
RESULTS	Significantly more women in the anastrozole group complained of hot flushes at @ months ( @ of @ [ @ % ] vs @ of @ [ @ % ] , p = @ , not corrected for multiple comparison ) , but this was the only difference in reported endocrine symptoms .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings show little or no impairment of cognitive performance with the use of anastrozole compared with placebo in postmenopausal women at high risk of developing breast cancer who were able to tolerate endocrine-related side-effects .
CONCLUSIONS	Future studies assessing cognition should be done within randomised trials with baseline assessments to ascertain the true extent of the putative effects that treatments for breast cancer might have on memory and attention .

OBJECTIVE	To minimize stent-related symptoms , the proximal part of the Polaris stent is composed of a firm material and its distal part is composed of a soft material .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to compare stent-related symptoms of Polaris and Percuflex stents and to assess the impacts of these stents on quality of life .
METHODS	A total of @ patients were randomized to a `` test '' group ( Polaris ; n = @ ) or a `` conventional '' group ( Percuflex ; n = @ ) at the time of ureteral stent insertion after ureteroscopic stone removal surgery .
METHODS	Stents were allocated using a randomization program .
METHODS	At @ week postoperatively , patient symptoms were evaluated using the Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire ( USSQ ) , and patients were asked complete a @cm visual analogue scale ( VAS ) .
METHODS	Mean scores for USSQ domains and mean VAS scores were compared .
RESULTS	Mean patient age was @ years , and the male-to-female ratio was @:@ .
RESULTS	No significant intergroup differences were found in the domain scores of urinary symptoms ( P = @ ) , pain ( P = @ ) , general health ( P = @ ) , work ( P = @ ) , sexual activity ( P = @ ) , or additional problems ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	In addition , VAS scores were nonsignificantly different ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Analysis of USSQ item scores , however , revealed the test group had better results for `` presence of pain , '' `` frequency of pain killer use , '' `` difficulties with respect to hard physical activity , '' `` fatigue , '' `` frequency of rest , '' `` stent-related impact on work , '' `` antibiotics use '' than the conventional group except for `` outpatient department visits '' .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the conventional Percuflex ureteral stent , the new Polaris ureteral stent with a soft tail was not found to offer significant advantages in terms of voiding symptoms , pain , general health , sexual matters , or additional problems as determined by the USSQ or in VAS determined pain .
CONCLUSIONS	Sub-analysis , however , showed that the Polaris has some advantages with respect to pain , physical activities , impact on work , and additional problems .
CONCLUSIONS	Accordingly , the soft-tipped Polaris stent was found to have some clinical advantages over the conventional Percuflex stent .

BACKGROUND	Investigations into tanners ' reasons for tanning have focused primarily on the perception of improved appearance .
BACKGROUND	Reported relaxing effects of tanning suggest the possibility of a physiologic effect of UV that drives tanning behavior .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine if there is a physiologic reinforcing effect of UV exposure , separate from appearance motivation , that may contribute to tanning behavior .
METHODS	We determined the reinforcing effect of UV light in a series of controlled , blinded , repeated-choice trials of UV carefully designed to separate as cleanly as possible reinforcing effects of UV exposure from other factors including perceived benefits of having a tan .
METHODS	A total of @ young adults who used tanning beds regularly were exposed to otherwise identical UV and non-UV tanning bed stimuli on Mondays and Wednesdays for @ weeks .
METHODS	On Fridays , participants had concurrent access to the two beds .
METHODS	The primary dependent variable was the percentage of choice sessions during which more UV than non-UV tanning was chosen .
RESULTS	In all , @ participants chose additional tanning exposure on Fridays and , of these , @ consistently used the UV bed for that exposure .
RESULTS	Of the total @ occasions when participants chose to tan on Friday , @ sessions ( @ % ) were for the UV bed and only two for the non-UV bed .
RESULTS	A more relaxed and less tense mood was reported after UV exposure compared with after non-UV exposure ( P = @ and P = @ , respectively ) .
CONCLUSIONS	When exposed to UV and non-UV under blinded conditions , frequent tanners can distinguish the two conditions and undertake further UV exposure , indicating that UV is a reinforcing stimulus .
CONCLUSIONS	The relaxing and reinforcing effects of UV exposure contribute to tanning behavior in frequent tanners and should be explored in greater detail .

OBJECTIVE	To more efficiently determine the subcritical crack growth ( SCG ) parameters of dental ceramics , the effects of stressing rate and choice of statistical regression model on estimates of SCG parameters were assessed .
METHODS	Two dental ceramic materials , a veneering material having a single critical flaw population ( S ) and a framework material having partially concurrent flaw populations ( PC ) , were analyzed using constant stress-rate testing , or `` dynamic fatigue '' , with a variety of testing protocols .
METHODS	For each material , @ rectangular beam specimens were prepared and tested in four-point flexure according to ISO@ and ASTM@ .
METHODS	A full-factorial study was conducted on the following factors : material , stress rate assumed vs. calculated , number of stress rates , and statistical regression method .
RESULTS	The proportion of specimens for which the statistical models over-estimated reliability was not significantly different based on regression method for Material S ( P = @ , power = @ % ) and was significantly different based on regression method for Material PC ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The standard method resulted in SCG parameters , n and l nB , of @ and -@ MPa ( @ ) s for Material S and @ and @ MPa ( @ ) s for Material PC , respectively .
CONCLUSIONS	The method of calculation that uses only the median strength value at each stress rate provided the most robust SCG parameter estimates .
CONCLUSIONS	Using only two stress rates resulted in fatigue parameters comparable to those estimated using four stress rates having the same range .
CONCLUSIONS	The stress rate of each specimen can be assumed to be the target stress rate with negligible difference in SCG parameter estimates .

BACKGROUND	Conflicting views exist according to the individual philosophy about various plate designs that can be used in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion ( ACDF ) to achieve clinical and radiological improvement within shortest time period .
BACKGROUND	No prospective randomized study has ever been conducted to clarify the relationship between clinical outcomes , fusion rates , and the choice of plate ( static vs. dynamic design ) .
OBJECTIVE	To compare the clinical and radiological outcomes of patients treated with one-level or multiple levels ACDF using cervical plates of dynamic ( slotted-holes ) versus static ( fixed-holes ) design .
METHODS	Single masked , prospective , randomized study .
METHODS	Over a @-year period , @ patients ( M : F = @:@ ) had ACDF using either dynamic ( n = @ ) or static ( n = @ ) plates for intractable radiculopathy as the result of degenerative cervical spine disease .
METHODS	Overall , @ patients had single-level fusion and @ had two or three levels fused .
METHODS	Visual Analogue Pain scores ( VASs ) , Neck Disability Index ( NDI ) , and radiological criteria of established fusion .
METHODS	The qualifying subjects were randomized to receive ACDF using either fixed-holes ( static ) or the slotted-holes ( dynamic ) anterior cervical plates .
METHODS	Clinical and radiographic data were collected and analyzed .
METHODS	Paired-sample t test was used to correlate clinical and radiological outcomes and General Linear Model Analysis of Variance ( GLM ANOVA ) with repeated measures was used to detect outcome differences between the two groups for single and multiple fusions .
RESULTS	At a mean follow-up of @ months ( range , @-@ ) , @ patients ( @ % ) had clinical success and @ ( @ % ) showed radiological fusion .
RESULTS	Although clinical success was a predictor of fusion ( p = @ ) , the reverse was not true ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In single-level fusion , no statistical difference of outcome was observed between the two groups but multilevel fusions with dynamic plate showed significantly lower VAS and NDI than those with static plates ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Although clinical improvement is a good predictor of successful ACDF , radiological evidence of fusion alone is not reliable as a parameter of success .
CONCLUSIONS	The design of plate does not affect the outcomes in single-level fusions but statistics indicate that multiple-level fusions may have better clinical outcome when a dynamic plate design is used .

RESULTS	There was no significant difference in operative time , the recovery of neurological function between the two groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	Perioperative blood loss volume and postoperative drainage volume of treatment group was less than that of control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	And in Denis classification of lumbar and back pain , the treatment group recovered more quickly , and the residual pain of lumbar and back was less than that of control group ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Postoperative posterior salient and compression of anterior border of vertebral body improved in two groups ( P < @ ) , there was no significant difference in degree of improvement between two groups ( P > @ ) ; but both loss existed at final follow-up ( P < @ ) , there was no significant difference in loss of posterior salient between two groups ( P > @ ) .
RESULTS	In the treatment group , the loss of rectify of anterior border of vertebral body existed , but it was less than that of the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	In the premise of strict controlling surgery indications , the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures with single-segment pedicle screw fixation through the gap of paraspinal muscles , can effectively recover the height of vertebral body and rectify posterior salient , and reduce the fixed segment .
CONCLUSIONS	Compared with the traditional operative method of double-segment pedicle screw fixation through the stripping of paraspinal muscle , it can obviously reduce the operation wound and the bleeding , lessen the pain of lumbar and back .

OBJECTIVE	There is increasing interest in identifying patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype @ or @ infection in whom it is possible to lower the burden of therapy while retaining high levels of efficacy .
METHODS	Treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype @/@ infection were randomized to receive peginterferon alfa-@b ( @ g/kg/wk ) for @weeks ( group A ) ; peginterferon alfa-@b ( @ g/kg/wk ) for @weeks ( group B ) ; or peginterferon alfa-@b ( @ g/kg/wk ) for @weeks ( group C ) , each in combination with weight-based ribavirin ( @-@mg / d ) .
METHODS	The study population comprised two cohorts : the Hep-Net cohort enrolled in Germany and an International cohort enrolled at study sites throughout Europe and Asia .
METHODS	The primary end point was sustained virological response ( SVR ) .
RESULTS	The study included @ patients ; @ % had genotype @ infection .
RESULTS	In the intent-to-treat population , SVR rates were @ % , @ % , and @ % in groups A , B , and C , and were similar in Asian and white patients .
RESULTS	Treatment differences ( A vs. B and A vs. C ) failed to reach the predefined margin for noninferiority of -@ % ; and thus groups B and C failed to show noninferiority relative to group A. Among patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week @ , SVR rates were @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Relapse rates were @ % , @ % , and @ % , respectively .
RESULTS	Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were highest in group A and lowest in group C , and adverse events leading to discontinuation were similar across treatment arms .
CONCLUSIONS	For patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype @/@ infection , @weeks of peginterferon alfa-@b ( @ g/kg/wk ) plus weight-based ribavirin remains a standard-of-care therapy ; however , treatment for @weeks may be considered for patients with undetectable HCV RNA at week @ of the treatment .

BACKGROUND	The addition of clonidine to local anesthetics has been shown to prolong both peripheral and central neuraxial local anesthetic blocks .
BACKGROUND	Whether clonidine prolongs local anesthetic block by a pharmacokinetic effect or a pharmacodynamic effect is unclear .
BACKGROUND	By directly measuring lidocaine tissue concentrations at the site of injection in the presence and absence of clonidine , this study was designed to address this question .
METHODS	Microdialysis probes were placed adjacent to the superficial peroneal nerve in both feet of seven volunteers .
METHODS	Plain lidocaine ( @ % ) was injected along one nerve , and lidocaine with clonidine ( @ microg/ml ) was injected along the other nerve in a double-blind , randomized manner .
METHODS	The extracellular fluid was then sampled for lidocaine concentration at @-min intervals using microdialysis , cutaneous blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler at @-min intervals , and sensory block was assessed every @ min until resolution .
RESULTS	Consistent with previous studies , clonidine prolonged lidocaine sensory block .
RESULTS	Blood flow increased in both groups but was significantly lower in the clonidine group , especially during the first @ min .
RESULTS	Consistent with the lower blood flow , the area under the lidocaine concentration-versus-time curve was significantly greater in the clonidine group during the first @ min .
CONCLUSIONS	When added to lidocaine , clonidine prolonged peripheral nerve block .
CONCLUSIONS	The pharmacokinetic data suggest that the mechanism of prolongation is at least in part pharmacokinetic .

OBJECTIVE	Epidemiologic studies indicate that soy intake has an important role in the prevention of age-related health problems .
OBJECTIVE	Daidzein , the principal isoflavone contained in soy , is converted to S-equol by the intestinal bacteria .
OBJECTIVE	Not all individuals , however , can produce S-equol , which is considered the most biologically active metabolite .
OBJECTIVE	We studied the effects of a natural S-equol supplement on metabolic parameters associated with overweight or obesity and metabolic syndrome .
METHODS	The study was a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , crossover design with no washout period .
METHODS	All subjects were considered overweight or obese if they had a body mass index @ kg/m ( @ ) .
METHODS	Placebo or natural S-equol tablets containing @ mg S-equol were orally ingested each day for @ weeks .
METHODS	A total of @ Japanese overweight or obese outpatients were enrolled .
METHODS	The equol phenotype was determined , and various metabolic parameters , including cardio-ankle vascular index ( CAVI ) , were measured .
RESULTS	Equol non-producers comprised @ % of the overweight or obese subjects .
RESULTS	The ratio of equol non-producers in this overweight or obese subject group was higher than the previously reported ratio of equol non-producers ( approximately @ % ) in the general population .
RESULTS	Compared with the placebo group , intervention with natural S-equol led to a significant decrease in HbA@c , serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) levels and CAVI score .
RESULTS	Furthermore , the effect was more prominent in the subgroup of female equol non-producers .
CONCLUSIONS	The ratio of equol non-producers in overweight or obese populations might be higher than generally reported .
CONCLUSIONS	Natural S-equol might have a role in glycaemic control and in the prevention of cardiovascular disease by its effects to lower LDL-C levels and CAVI scores in overweight or obese individuals .

BACKGROUND	This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine and desipramine in treating depressive symptoms in women with cancer .
METHODS	In this prospective , @-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial , we compared fluoxetine with desipramine in treating depressive symptoms in @ women diagnosed with cancer .
METHODS	Scales used to measure efficacy and tolerability were the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , the Clinical and Patient 's Global Impression ( CGI and PGI ) scales , the Functional Living Index for Cancer ( FLIC ) , the Memorial Pain Assessment Card ( MPAC ) , and the SF-@ Health Survey .
RESULTS	Fluoxetine and desipramine treatments improved depression and anxiety symptoms .
RESULTS	There was a trend towards significance in improvement of FLIC scores ( as evidenced by greater numerical improvements with fluoxetine treatment ) .
RESULTS	Fluoxetine treatment alone was associated with statistically significant improvements in MPAC Mood scale scores .
RESULTS	Both treatments showed statistically significant improvements in the quality of life SF-@ scores in Role Emotional , Social Functioning , Mental Health , and Vitality .
CONCLUSIONS	Both fluoxetine and desipramine were effective and well-tolerated in improving depressive symptoms and quality of life in women with advanced cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	Fluoxetine may offer greater benefit to these patients , as evidenced by greater improvements in fluoxetine-treated patients on several quality of life measures .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results , while meaningful , should be confirmed in a larger patients sample .
CONCLUSIONS	However , experience from studies of antidepressant use in patients with advanced cancer has shown that intercurrent disease and treatment variables make it difficult to conduct large studies .

BACKGROUND	Treatment of bronchiectasis includes drugs , oxygen therapy , and bronchial-clearance maneuvers .
OBJECTIVE	To assess the safety and efficacy of intrapulmonary percussive ventilation ( IPV ) compared to traditional standard chest physical therapy in patients with bronchiectasis and productive cough .
METHODS	In a randomized crossover study , @ patients underwent , on consecutive days , IPV and chest physical therapy .
METHODS	Before each treatment session , immediately after the session , @ min after the session , and @ hours after the session we measured S ( pO ( @ ) ) , heart rate , respiratory rate , and ( with a visual analog scale ) the patient 's subjective sensation of phlegm encumbrance and dyspnea .
METHODS	Immediately after each treatment session we also measured ( via visual analog scale ) the patient 's discomfort .
METHODS	We also measured the volume and wet and dry weight of collected sputum .
RESULTS	No adverse effects were so severe as to require discontinuation of treatment , and the incidence of adverse effects was similar in the groups ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	Heart rate ( P = @ ) and respiratory rate ( P = @ ) decreased during treatment , and sensation of phlegm encumbrance improved ( P = @ ) with both treatments .
RESULTS	Only IPV improved ( P = @ ) the sensation of dyspnea .
RESULTS	The patients found IPV more comfortable than our traditional standard chest physical therapy ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Both treatments caused important phlegm production , but there were no differences in sputum volume , wet weight , or dry weight .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with bronchiectasis and productive cough , short-term IPV was as safe and effective as traditional chest physical therapy , with less discomfort .

BACKGROUND	Cognitive impairment , the most important adverse effect of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , may involve elevated intracellular calcium ion signaling .
BACKGROUND	Animal research suggests that calcium channel-blocking agents , which attenuate excessive intracellular calcium activity , may reduce cognitive dysfunction caused by ECT .
METHODS	The lipid-soluble calcium channel-blocking drug nicardipine or matching placebo were randomly assigned to @ patients with major depressive disorder receiving ECT .
METHODS	A rater blind to the experimental condition administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale , the Beck Depression Inventory , the Mini-Mental State Examination and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests prior to ECT , at the completion of ECT , and @ months after ECT completion .
RESULTS	Compared with patients receiving placebo , patients taking nicardipine had significantly lower scores on the Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg but not the Beck Depression rating scale scores at the completion of ECT .
RESULTS	There were no differences between placebo and nicardipine groups in depression scores @ months after ECT .
RESULTS	Cognitive function declined over the course of ECT and improved over the next @ months in both groups , but changes were statistically significant for only two subtests on the neuropsychological battery .
RESULTS	Changes in Mini-Mental State Examination scores were small and were not significant at any point .
RESULTS	There were no significant differences between nicardipine and placebo treated groups in any assessment of cognition .
CONCLUSIONS	Standard approaches to ECT in younger patients without preexisting neurological impairment do not produce cognitive side effects of sufficient severity for calcium channel-blocking agents to reduce these side effects demonstrably .
CONCLUSIONS	Studies of treatments for cognitive impairment should be conducted in patients with risk factors for more severe cognitive impairment such as geriatric patients or patients with a history of interictal delirium during previous treatment with ECT .
CONCLUSIONS	A possible effect of nicardipine in enhancing the antidepressant action of ECT requires further investigation in a study designed to test this action .

BACKGROUND	Emotional states linked to arousal and mood are known to affect the efficiency of cognitive performance .
BACKGROUND	However , the extent to which memory processes may be affected by arousal , mood or their interaction is poorly understood .
RESULTS	Following a study phase of abstract shapes , we altered the emotional state of participants by means of exposure to music that varied in both mood and arousal dimensions , leading to four different emotional states : ( i ) positive mood-high arousal ; ( ii ) positive mood-low arousal ; ( iii ) negative mood-high arousal ; ( iv ) negative mood-low arousal .
RESULTS	Following the emotional induction , participants performed a memory recognition test .
RESULTS	Critically , there was an interaction between mood and arousal on recognition performance .
RESULTS	Memory was enhanced in the positive mood-high arousal and in the negative mood-low arousal states , relative to the other emotional conditions .
CONCLUSIONS	Neither mood nor arousal alone but their interaction appears most critical to understanding the emotional enhancement of memory .

OBJECTIVE	To examine the effect of grapefruit juice , an inhibitor of CYP@A@ in the small intestine , on the disposition of manidipine enantiomers in healthy subjects .
METHODS	A randomized cross-over study with at least a @-week wash-out period was performed .
METHODS	Seven healthy male volunteers received an oral @-mg dose of racemic manidipine after an overnight fast with either grapefruit juice ( GFJ ) or water , as a control study .
METHODS	Plasma concentrations of ( S ) - and ( R ) - manidipine were monitored up to @ h after the dosing .
RESULTS	The plasma concentrations of ( S ) - manidipine were significantly higher ( P < @ ) than those of ( R ) - manidipine in the control phase with an S/R ratio for the AUC@-infinity of @ ( @ % confidence interval @ , @ ) .
RESULTS	GFJ significantly increased Cmax and AUC@-infinity of ( S ) - manidipine by @-fold ( P < @ ) and @-fold ( P < @ ) , respectively , and Cmax and AUC@-infinity of ( R ) - manidipine were increased by @-fold ( P < @ ) and @-fold ( P < @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	There were significant differences ( P < @ ) in GFJ-mediated percentage increases in Cmax and AUC@-infinity of ( S ) - manidipine compared with those of ( R ) - manidipine .
RESULTS	The S/R ratio for AUC@-infinity was significantly decreased from @ to @ during the GFJ phase ( P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	These results indicate that the stereoselective disposition of manidipine was altered by GFJ , as an inhibitor of CYP@A@ .
CONCLUSIONS	GFJ appears to affect this metabolic disposal of ( R ) - manidipine to a greater extent than that of ( S ) - manidipine .

OBJECTIVE	Recently , a modified version of a successful soft drink has been developed that aims to reduce the potential for dental erosion in consumers .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this investigation was to compare the effect of the modified and original formula soft drink on the pH at various tooth surfaces during and after ingestion in subjects without erosion .
METHODS	Fifteen subjects ( @ female and @ male ) without dental erosion drank both a modified and an unmodified beverage for over @ minutes in a randomized order .
METHODS	Oral pH was measured with antimony electrodes positioned on the labial and palatal surfaces of an incisor and premolar and held in place by a close-fitting vacuum-formed appliance .
METHODS	The results were compared ( using the Wilcoxon signed rank test , with matched pairs ) for the percentage and total time that pH fell below @ , @ , and @ .
RESULTS	The percentage and total time that pH fell below @ was significantly different between the drinks ( P < @ ) , but the total time that pH fell below @ and @ was not .
RESULTS	The time taken for subjects to return to pre-exposure pH levels in the mouth showed considerable variation between individuals .
CONCLUSIONS	The modified-formula drink appeared to have less erosive potential than the original formula when assessed by measuring pH at the tooth surface .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the erosive potential has been reduced by modifying the soft drink , it has not been eliminated .

BACKGROUND	We previously reported that maternal micronutrient supplementation in rural Nepal decreased low birth weight by approximately @ % .
OBJECTIVE	We examined the effect of daily maternal micronutrient supplementation on fetal loss and infant mortality .
METHODS	The study was a double-blind , cluster-randomized , controlled trial among @ pregnant women and their @ infants in rural Nepal .
METHODS	In addition to vitamin A ( @ microg retinol equivalents ) , the intervention groups received either folic acid ( FA ; @ microg ) , FA + iron ( @ mg ) , FA + iron + zinc ( @ mg ) , or multiple micronutrients ( MNs ; the foregoing plus @ microg vitamin D , @ mg vitamin E , @ mg thiamine , @ mg riboflavin , @ mg vitamin B-@ , @ microg vitamin B-@ , @ mg vitamin C , @ microg vitamin K , @ mg niacin , @ mg Cu , and @ mg Mg ) .
METHODS	The control group received vitamin A only .
RESULTS	None of the supplements reduced fetal loss .
RESULTS	Compared with control infants , infants whose mothers received FA alone or with iron or iron + zinc had a consistent pattern of @-@ % lower @-mo mortality ; this pattern was not observed with MNs .
RESULTS	The effect on mortality was restricted to preterm infants , among whom the relative risks ( RRs ) were @ ( @ % CI : @ , @ ) for FA , @ ( @ , @ ) for FA + iron , @ ( @ , @ ) for FA + iron + zinc , and @ ( @ , @ ) for MNs .
RESULTS	Among term infants , the RR for mortality was close to @ for all supplements except MNs ( RR : @ ; @ % CI : @ , @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Maternal micronutrient supplementation failed to reduce overall fetal loss or early infant mortality .
CONCLUSIONS	Among preterm infants , FA alone or with iron reduced mortality in the first @ mo of life .
CONCLUSIONS	MNs may increase mortality risk among term infants , but this effect needs further evaluation .

BACKGROUND	The intubating laryngeal mask airway ( ILMA ; Fastrach ; Laryngeal Mask Company , Henley-on-Thames , UK ) may provide an alternative technique to fiberoptic intubation ( FIB ) to facilitate the management of the anticipated difficult airway .
BACKGROUND	The authors therefore compared the effectiveness of the ILMA with FIB in patients with anticipated difficult intubation .
METHODS	One hundred patients , with at least one difficult intubation criteria ( Mallampati class III or IV , thyromental distance < @ mm , interincisor distance < @ mm ) were enrolled ( FIB group , n = @ ; ILMA group , n = @ ) in this prospective randomized study .
METHODS	Anesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with alfentanil and propofol after an efficient mask ventilation has been demonstrated .
METHODS	The success of the technique ( within three attempts ) , the number of attempts , duration of the successful attempt , and adverse events ( oxygen saturation < @ % , bleeding ) were recorded .
RESULTS	The rate of successful tracheal intubation with ILMA was @ % and comparable with FIB ( @ % ) .
RESULTS	The number of attempts and the time to succeed were not significantly different between groups .
RESULTS	In case of failure of the first technique , the alternative technique always succeeded .
RESULTS	Failures in FIB group were related to oxygen desaturation ( oxygen saturation < @ % ) and bleeding , and to previous cervical radiotherapy in the ILMA group .
RESULTS	Adverse events occurred significantly more frequently in FIB group than in ILMA group ( @ vs. @ % , P < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The authors obtained a high success rate and comparable duration of tracheal intubation with ILMA and FIB techniques .
CONCLUSIONS	In patients with previous cervical radiotherapy , the use of ILMA can not be recommended .
CONCLUSIONS	Nevertheless , the use of the ILMA was associated with fewer adverse events .

OBJECTIVE	The primary objective was to conduct a detailed analysis of individual variation in psychological morbidity in the year following surgery for breast cancer .
OBJECTIVE	The salience of the patients ' `` illness perceptions '' to morbidity was examined as a secondary objective .
METHODS	Psychological morbidity was assessed with the General Health Questionnaire ( GHQ-@ ) in a prospective study of @ women having surgery for primary breast cancer .
METHODS	Patients also completed the Illness Perception Questionnaire ( IPQ ) , Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale ( MAC ) and the Eysenck Personality Scales ( EPS ) .
METHODS	Assessments were made postoperatively and at @ , @ and @ months after surgery .
RESULTS	Whilst descriptive statistics indicated a general reduction in mean distress over the @-month follow-up , close analysis showed that a quarter of all patients maintained clinically significant levels of distress throughout the period .
RESULTS	Patients with chronically elevated distress were characterised by higher levels of neuroticism , greater symptom awareness , more pain and poorer self-rated general health .
RESULTS	In the regression analysis , psychological morbidity across the @-year follow-up was predicted principally by the immediate postoperative state of distress , IPQ symptom awareness and the perceived time line of the illness , general health and , to a more minor extent , by neuroticism .
CONCLUSIONS	There is marked individual variation in psychological morbidity in the year following breast cancer surgery , which is reliably predicted by the patient 's immediate postoperative state of distress , her perception of the impact of the symptoms and the time line of the disease .
CONCLUSIONS	Subgroups of patients with chronically high distress are characterised by factors including personality and negative perceptions and beliefs about their illness .

BACKGROUND	Neuropeptide Y ( NPY ) and serotonergic systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression but have not yet been linked together .
METHODS	In a randomized , double-blind crossover study , @ medication-free patients with remitted depression and @ healthy control subjects underwent tryptophan depletion ( TD ) and sham depletion .
METHODS	Plasma NPY concentrations were determined at baseline and at +@ , +@ , and +@ h during TD and sham depletion , respectively .
METHODS	Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS , @-item ) scores were assessed at baseline and at +@ and +@ h after TD and sham depletion , respectively .
RESULTS	There was no difference between healthy subjects and patients with remitted depression in baseline plasma NPY concentrations and in plasma NPY concentrations during TD and sham depletion , respectively .
RESULTS	Plasma NPY concentrations did not differ between TD and sham depletion .
RESULTS	At no time point there was an association between HDRS scores and plasma NPY concentrations in patients with remitted depression .
CONCLUSIONS	Plasma NPY concentrations in rMDD patients were not obtained during the symptomatic phase of the illness .
CONCLUSIONS	Only peripheral measurements of NPY were used .
CONCLUSIONS	Decreased plasma NPY concentrations , as described previously during a spontaneous episode of major depression , appear as state but not as trait marker in depression .
CONCLUSIONS	No evidence was found for an involvement of plasma NPY in relapse during TD .
CONCLUSIONS	There appears no direct functional link between serotonergic neurotransmission and plasma NPY concentrations .

BACKGROUND	Although dietary fibre has been reported to have no association with colorectal adenoma and cancer , in some studies this topic remains controversial .
METHODS	We used a @-item food frequency questionnaire to assess the relation of fibre intake and frequency of colorectal adenoma .
METHODS	The study was done within the Prostate , Lung , Colorectal , and Ovarian ( PLCO ) Cancer Screening Trial , a randomised controlled trial designed to investigate methods for early detection of cancer .
METHODS	In our analysis , we compared fibre intake of @ participants who were sigmoidoscopy-negative for polyps , with @ cases with at least one histologically verified adenoma in the distal large bowel ( ie , descending colon , sigmoid colon , or rectum ) .
METHODS	Odds ratios were estimated by logistic regression analysis .
RESULTS	High intakes of dietary fibre were associated with a lower risk of colorectal adenoma , after adjustment for potential dietary and non-dietary risk factors .
RESULTS	Participants in the highest quintile of dietary fibre intake had a @ % ( @ % CI @-@ , p ( trend ) = @ ) lower risk of adenoma than those in the lowest quintile .
RESULTS	The inverse association was strongest for fibre from grains and cereals and from fruits .
RESULTS	Risks were similar for advanced and non-advanced adenoma .
RESULTS	Risk of rectal adenoma was not significantly associated with fibre intake .
CONCLUSIONS	Dietary fibre , particularly from grains , cereals , and fruits , was associated with decreased risk of distal colon adenoma .

OBJECTIVE	The intravenous administration of interferon-beta may be effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C , as is intramuscular interferon-beta .
OBJECTIVE	We compared the efficacy and safety of twice-a-day versus once-a-day of natural interferon-beta for the initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C.
METHODS	Forty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C , with less than @ Meq/mL serum hepatitis C virus-RNA , were randomly assigned into one of the two treatment groups A and B and treated with natural interferon-beta following two different protocols .
METHODS	Twenty-two patients were treated with twice-a-day interferon-beta ( @ MU ) for @ weeks followed by once-a-day interferon-beta ( @ MU ) for @ weeks ( group A ) , and @ patients were treated with once-a-day interferon-beta ( @ MU ) for @ weeks ( group B ) .
METHODS	Seven patients did not complete the treatment protocol .
METHODS	Efficacy was assessed by measuring the serum levels of hepatitis C virus-RNA and aminotransferase .
RESULTS	The rate of sustained virological response was significantly higher in group A ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) than in group B ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Among patients with hepatitis C virus-RNA level less than @ Meq/mL , the sustained virological response rate was significantly higher in group A ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) than in group B ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	However , the sustained virological response rate in patients with hepatitis C virus levels more than @ Meq/mL was not significantly different between group A ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) and group B ( @ of @ patients , @ % ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Twice-a-day interferon-beta therapy is more effective than once-a-day interferon-beta for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C patients with hepatitis C virus-RNA levels less than @ Meq/mL .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether , following aerosolization of lidocaine for topical airway anesthesia , intravenous ( IV ) lidocaine produces toxic lidocaine blood concentrations .
METHODS	Randomized , double-blind study .
METHODS	University-affiliated hospital .
METHODS	Forty healthy patients scheduled for outpatient surgery .
METHODS	The patients received in a randomized , double-blind manner aerosolized lidocaine or placebo followed @ minutes later by IV lidocaine or placebo .
RESULTS	After completion of lidocaine or placebo aerosolization and @ minutes following IV administration of either lidocaine or the placebo , venous blood samples were obtained .
RESULTS	Lidocaine concentration was measured using a homogenous enzyme assay .
RESULTS	The group receiving both aerosolized and IV placebo and the group receiving aerosolized lidocaine and an IV placebo had undetectable ( less than @ micrograms/ml ) serum lidocaine levels .
RESULTS	The groups that received either an aerosolized placebo or aerosolized lidocaine and IV lidocaine had similar serum lidocaine concentrations [ @ + / - @ vs. @ + / - @ micrograms/ml ( mean + / - SEM ) ; p greater than @ by Mann-Whitney U test ] .
CONCLUSIONS	IV lidocaine can be safely administered following aerosolization of lidocaine in spontaneously breathing patients without producing toxic blood lidocaine concentrations .

OBJECTIVE	We recently reported that acupuncture treatment of stroke patients in the subacute stage gave additive therapeutic benefit .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of the present study was to determine , approximately one year after discharge from the rehabilitation hospital , whether the group differences still remained .
METHODS	The patients were randomized into two groups : one acupuncture group and one control group , considering gender and side of hemispheral localization of lesion .
METHODS	With regard to the main parameters the groups were comparable at baseline .
METHODS	Initially , @ stroke patients admitted to Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital were included in the study : median @ days post stroke .
METHODS	Forty-one of the patients were available one year after the treatment period : @ patients in the acupuncture group and @ controls .
METHODS	All subjects received an individually adapted , multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme .
METHODS	The acupuncture group received additional treatment with classical acupuncture for @ min three to four times weekly for six weeks .
METHODS	The patients were evaluated at inclusion , after six weeks and approximately @ months after discharge from the rehabilitation hospital .
METHODS	The Motor Assessment Scale ( MAS ) for stroke patients , Sunnaas Index of Activity of Daily Living ( ADL ) and Nottingham Health Profile ( NHP ) were used .
METHODS	In addition , the social situations of the patients were recorded at one year follow-up .
RESULTS	The results show that the acupuncture group improved significantly more than the controls , both during the treatment period of six weeks , and even more during the following year , both according to MAS , ADL , NHP and the social situation .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the mechanism of the effects is debatable , there seems to be a positive long-term effect of acupuncture given in the subacute stage post stroke .

BACKGROUND	: Effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression is an important therapeutic goal in complicated and atypical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease .
OBJECTIVE	: To compare the efficacy of lansoprazole and pantoprazole in normalizing oesophageal acid exposure .
METHODS	: Fifty patients with complicated or atypical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease were randomly assigned to receive @ mg lansoprazole ( n = @ ) or @ mg pantoprazole ( n = @ ) once daily .
METHODS	Three to four weeks after the start of treatment , patients underwent @-h oesophageal pH monitoring whilst on therapy .
METHODS	If the results were improved but still abnormal , the dosage was doubled and pH monitoring was repeated .
METHODS	If oesophageal acid exposure was not improved , the patient was shifted to the alternative drug regimen .
RESULTS	: Oesophageal acid exposure was normalized in all @ patients treated with lansoprazole ( in @ % of cases with a double daily dosage ) , whereas in six of the @ ( @ % ) patients treated with pantoprazole it was neither normalized nor lowered ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Accordingly , the mean percentage acid reflux time was significantly lower for the lansoprazole group ( @ ) than for the pantoprazole group ( @ ) ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	: Effective intra-oesophageal acid suppression can be accomplished more reliably with lansoprazole than with pantoprazole in patients with complicated and atypical gastro-oesophageal reflux disease .

OBJECTIVE	The primary purpose of this study was to test a relatively efficient strategy for enhancing the capacity of juvenile drug courts ( JDC ) to reduce youth substance use and criminal behavior by incorporating components of evidence-based treatments into their existing services .
METHODS	Six JDCs were randomized to a condition in which therapists were trained to deliver contingency management in combination with family engagement strategies ( CM-FAM ) or to continue their usual services ( US ) .
METHODS	Participants included @ juvenile offenders ( average age = @ years ; @ % male ; @ % White , @ % African American , @ % Biracial ) .
METHODS	Eighty-six percent of the youths met criteria for at least @ substance use disorder , and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses were highly prevalent .
METHODS	Biological and self-report measures of substance use and self-reported delinquency were assessed from baseline through @ months postrecruitment .
RESULTS	CM-FAM was significantly more effective than US at reducing marijuana use , based on urine drug screens , and at reducing both crimes against persons and property offenses .
RESULTS	Such favorable outcomes , however , were not observed for the self-report measure of substance use .
RESULTS	Although some variation in outcomes was observed between courts , the outcomes were not moderated by demographic characteristics or co-occurring psychiatric disorders .
CONCLUSIONS	The findings suggest that JDC practices can be enhanced to improve outcomes for participating juvenile offenders .
CONCLUSIONS	A vehicle for promoting such enhancements might pertain to the development and implementation of program certification standards that support the use of evidence-based interventions by JDCs .
CONCLUSIONS	Such standards have been fundamental to the successful transport of evidence-based treatments of juvenile offenders .

OBJECTIVE	To retrospectively evaluate the pattern of recurrence and outcome of node-negative breast cancer ( BC ) according to major subtypes .
METHODS	In all , @,@ patients with node-negative , early-stage BC randomly assigned in International Breast Cancer Study Group Trials VIII and IX with centrally reviewed pathology data were included .
METHODS	BC subtypes were defined as triple negative ( TN ; n = @ ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor @ ( HER@ ) positive ( n = @ ) , and hormone receptor positive with high ( luminal B-like [ LB-like ] ; n = @ ) or low ( luminal A-like [ LA-like ] ; n = @ ) proliferative activity by Ki-@ labeling index .
METHODS	BC-free interval ( BCFI ) events were invasive BC recurrence in local , contralateral breast , nodal , bone , or visceral sites .
METHODS	Time to first site-specific recurrence was evaluated by using cumulative incidence and competing risks regression analysis .
RESULTS	Median follow-up was @ years .
RESULTS	The @-year BCFI was higher for patients with LA-like ( @ % ) BC compared with LB-like ( @ % ) , HER@ ( @ % ) , and TN ( @ % ; P < @ ) BC .
RESULTS	TN and HER@ cohorts had higher hazard of BCFI event in the first @ years after diagnosis ( pre-trastuzumab ) .
RESULTS	LB-like cohorts had a continuously higher hazard of BCFI event over time compared with LA-like cohorts .
RESULTS	Ten-year overall survival was higher for LA-like ( @ % ) compared with LB-like ( @ % ) , HER@ ( @ % ) , and TN ( @ % ; P < @ ) BC .
RESULTS	LB-like subtypes had higher rates of bone as first recurrence site than other subtypes ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Visceral recurrence as first site was lower for the LA-like subgroup , with similar incidence among the other subgroups when treated with chemotherapy ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	BC subtypes have different distant recurrence patterns over time .
CONCLUSIONS	Defining different patterns of BC recurrence can improve BC care through surveillance guidelines and can guide the design of clinical studies .

BACKGROUND	An understanding of the relations among dietary zinc intake , bioavailability , and absorption is necessary for making dietary intake recommendations .
OBJECTIVE	We aimed to assess adaptation in human zinc absorption to controlled differences in zinc and phytate intakes and to apply the results to predictive models .
METHODS	In @ experiments , radiotracers were used to assess zinc absorption by healthy adults ( n = @ ) from controlled diets , before and after @ or @ wk of dietary equilibration .
METHODS	Subjects consumed @-@ mg Zn/d from @ of @ diets , @ with molar ratios of phytate to zinc from @ to @ and @ with ratios from @ to @ .
RESULTS	Absorptive efficiency was inversely related to dietary zinc from both low - and high-phytate diets .
RESULTS	In response to low zinc intakes ( < @ mg/d ) for @-@ wk , zinc absorption was up-regulated to as high as @ % , but only if the diets were low in phytate .
RESULTS	The results help validate and refine a published saturable transport model that predicts zinc absorption from dietary zinc and phytate .
RESULTS	Possible biomarkers of impaired zinc status , including erythrocyte osmotic fragility , in vitro erythrocyte ( @ ) Zn uptake , and leukocyte expression of the zinc transport proteins Zip@ and ZnT@ , were unresponsive to dietary zinc content .
CONCLUSIONS	Humans absorbed zinc more efficiently from low-zinc diets and adapted to further increase zinc absorption after consuming low-zinc , low-phytate diets for several weeks .
CONCLUSIONS	Such adaptation did not occur with higher phytate diets .
CONCLUSIONS	Zinc absorption can be predicted from dietary zinc and phytate after allowing for dietary equilibration .

OBJECTIVE	The aim of the study was to determine whether docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) supplementation improves the behavior of children with autism .
METHODS	A group of @ - to @-year-old children with autism were randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive a supplement containing @ mg of DHA or a placebo for @ months .
METHODS	The parents and the investigator completed the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement scale to rate changes in core symptoms of autism after @ and @ months .
METHODS	The parents completed the Child Development Inventory and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist , and both parents and teachers completed the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children ( BASC ) at enrollment and after @ months .
RESULTS	A total of @ children ( @ [ @ % ] boys , mean age [ standard deviation ] @ [ @ ] years ) were enrolled ; @ received DHA and @ placebo .
RESULTS	Despite a median @ % increase in total plasma DHA levels after @ months , the DHA group was not rated as improved in core symptoms of autism compared to the placebo group on the CGI-I .
RESULTS	Based on the analysis of covariance models adjusted for the baseline rating scores , parents ( but not teachers ) provided a higher average rating of social skills on the BASC for the children in the placebo group compared to the DHA group ( P = @ ) , and teachers ( but not parents ) provided a higher average rating of functional communication on the BASC for the children in the DHA group compared to the placebo group ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Dietary DHA supplementation of @ mg/day for @ months does not improve the core symptoms of autism .
CONCLUSIONS	Our results may have been limited by inadequate sample size .

BACKGROUND	Clinically useful predictions of end-organ function and failure in severe sepsis may be possible through analyzing the interactions among demographics , physiologic parameters , standard laboratory tests , and circulating markers of inflammation .
BACKGROUND	The present study evaluated the ability of such a methodology , the Systemic Mediator Associated Response Test ( SMART ) , to predict the clinical course of septic surgery patients from a database of medical and surgical patients with severe sepsis and/or septic shock .
METHODS	Three hundred and three patients entered into the placebo arm of a multi-institutional sepsis study were randomly assigned to a model-building cohort ( n = @ ; @ surgical ) or to a predictive cohort ( n = @ ; @ surgical ) .
METHODS	Using baseline and baseline plus serial measurements of physiologic data , standard laboratory tests , and plasma levels of IL-@ , IL-@ , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( GCSF ) , multivariate models were developed that predicted the presence or absence of pulmonary edema on chest radiography , and respiratory , renal , coagulation , hepatobiliary , or central nervous system dysfunction and shock in individual patients .
METHODS	Twenty-eight-day survival was predicted also in baseline plus serial data models .
METHODS	These models were validated prospectively by inserting baseline raw data from the @ surgical patients in the predictive cohort into the models built on the comprehensive training cohort , and calculating the area under the curve ( AUC ) of predicted versus observed receiver operator characteristic ( ROC ) plots .
RESULTS	SMART predictions of physiologic , respiratory , metabolic , hepatic , renal , and hematologic function indicators were validated prospectively , frequently at clinically useful levels of accuracy .
RESULTS	ROC AUC values above @ were achieved in @ out of @ ( @ % ) of SMART baseline models in predicting shock and organ failure up to @ days in advance , and in @ out of @ ( @ % ) of baseline plus serial data models .
CONCLUSIONS	SMART multivariate models accurately predict pathophysiology , shock , and organ failure in individual septic surgical patients .
CONCLUSIONS	These prognostications may facilitate early treatment of end-organ dysfunction in surgical sepsis .

BACKGROUND	The authors conducted a study to compare administration of local anesthetic using a computer-controlled delivery device with an aspirating syringe for therapeutic scaling and root planing .
BACKGROUND	The anterior middle superior alveolar , or AMSA , injection was compared with other maxillary injections .
METHODS	Twenty healthy adults with moderate periodontal disease participated in this single-blind crossover study .
METHODS	Subjects were evaluated by a trained examiner and were treated by experienced dental hygienists .
METHODS	Subjects provided written and verbal pain ratings via a visual analog scale , or VAS , and a verbal rating scale , or VRS .
METHODS	AMSA injections were compared with syringe-delivered injections -- greater palatine , or GP , and nasopalatine , or NP , blocks , and anterior superior alveolar and middle superior alveolar injections -- in maxillary quadrants .
METHODS	Bleeding and changes in attachment were evaluated after one month .
RESULTS	VAS and VRS scores for AMSA were significantly lower for computer-controlled delivery when compared with NP injections and combined maxillary injections ( VAS scores ) and with GP and combined maxillary injections ( VRS scores ) .
RESULTS	Mean injection times were similar for both groups .
RESULTS	Mean gains in attachment were equal , @ millimeters for quadrants anesthetized using computer-controlled injections and @ mm for syringe injections .
CONCLUSIONS	Subjects reported having less pain with GP and NP injections delivered using the computer-controlled device , and total injection time was similar to that required for syringe injections .
CONCLUSIONS	Both techniques provided adequate anesthesia for therapeutic scaling and root planing .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical Implications .
CONCLUSIONS	The two anesthetic delivery techniques were therapeutically equivalent for mandibular injections , and the AMSA injection has clinically significant advantages for maxillary injections .

BACKGROUND	This study was undertaken to examine the effects of acupuncture on smoking reduction and possibly also cessation and to examine whether some acupoints are more effective than others for smoking cessation .
METHODS	A total of @ healthy men and women , @ + / - @ years of age ( mean + / - SD ) , who smoked @ + / - @ cigarettes per day and had smoked for @ + / - @ years , and who wanted to quit smoking , volunteered to participate .
METHODS	The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups .
METHODS	One group was given acupuncture treatment at points previously used for anti-smoking ( test group , TG ) .
METHODS	The other group was given acupuncture treatment at points assumed to have no effect for smoking cessation ( control group , CG ) .
METHODS	Before each treatment and after the last treatment each subject answered questionnaires about his or her smoking habits and attitudes .
METHODS	In addition the concentrations of serum cotinine , serum thiocyanate , serum peroxides , and plasma fibrinogen were measured before the first and after the last acupuncture treatment .
RESULTS	The daily cigarette consumption fell during the treatment period in both groups , but the reduction was larger for TG than for CG ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	Altogether @ % of subjects in TG had quit smoking completely at the end of the treatment , compared with none in CG .
RESULTS	For TG the concentrations of cotinine and thiocyanate were reduced significantly after the treatment period ( P < @ ) , but no significant reductions were observed for CG .
RESULTS	For both groups the taste of tobacco worsened during the treatment period , but the effect was more pronounced for TG than for CG ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	The desire to smoke fell significantly in both groups after treatment , and the reduction was larger for TG than for CG ( P < @ ) .
RESULTS	No significant changes in serum peroxides and plasma fibrinogen concentrations were observed during the treatment period for either group .
CONCLUSIONS	This study suggests that acupuncture may help motivated smokers to reduce their smoking or even quit smoking completely .
CONCLUSIONS	Different acupoints appear to have different effects for smoking cessation and reduction .

RESULTS	After IT , immunoblot analysis demonstrated a significant increase in IgE binding in a band of approximately @ kDa ( P = @ ) that may correspond to Hev b @ .
RESULTS	New or more intense bands appeared in seven patients of the active group , while in three subjects a reduction was observed .
CONCLUSIONS	Hev b @ seems to be the most relevant latex allergen in HCWs .
CONCLUSIONS	New or more intense IgE binding to latex allergenic components occurs during latex immunotherapy .
CONCLUSIONS	However , the levels of specific IgE against these new components are low and do not seem to have clinical relevance .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether body balance is perturbed more in low back pain patients than in healthy subjects , under the concept of posturo-kinetic capacity .
METHODS	Comparison of posturographic and respiratory parameters between low back pain and healthy subjects .
BACKGROUND	It has been demonstrated that respiratory movements constitute a perturbation to posture , compensated by movements of the spine and of the hips , and that low back pain is frequently associated with a loss of back mobility .
METHODS	Ten low back pain patients and ten healthy subjects performed five posturographic tests under three different respiratory rate conditions : quiet breathing ( spontaneous ) , slow breathing ( @ Hz ) and fast breathing ( @ Hz ) .
RESULTS	Intergroup comparison showed that the mean displacements of the center of pressure were greater for the low back pain group , especially along the antero-posterior axis , where respiratory perturbation is primarily exerted .
RESULTS	Inter-condition comparison showed that in slow and fast breathing relatively to quiet breathing , the mean displacement of the center of pressure along the antero-posterior axis was significantly increased only for the low back pain group .
CONCLUSIONS	According to the results , respiration presented a greater disturbing effect on body balance in low back pain subjects .
CONCLUSIONS	This study provides information on the causes of the impaired body balance associated with chronic low back pain , which could be used to improve treatment strategy .

BACKGROUND	Substance use is highly prevalent among Dutch adolescents .
BACKGROUND	The Healthy School and Drugs program is a nationally implemented school-based prevention program aimed at reducing early and excessive substance use among adolescents .
BACKGROUND	Although the program 's effectiveness was tested in a quasi-experimental design before , many program changes were made afterwards .
BACKGROUND	The present study , therefore , aims to test the effects of this widely used , renewed universal prevention program .
METHODS	A randomized clustered trial will be conducted among @,@ adolescents of @ secondary schools in The Netherlands .
METHODS	The trial has three conditions ; two intervention conditions ( i.e. , e-learning and integral ) and a control condition .
METHODS	The e-learning condition consists of three digital learning modules ( i.e. , about alcohol , tobacco , and marijuana ) that are sequentially offered over the course of three school years ( i.e. , grade @ , grade @ , and grade @ ) .
METHODS	The integral condition consists of parental participation in a parental meeting on substance use , regulation of substance use , and monitoring and counseling of students ' substance use at school , over and above the three digital modules .
METHODS	The control condition is characterized as business as usual .
METHODS	Participating schools were randomly assigned to either an intervention or control condition.Participants filled out a digital questionnaire at baseline and will fill out the same questionnaire three more times at follow-up measurements ( @ , @ , and @ months after baseline ) .
METHODS	Outcome variables included in the questionnaire are the percentage of binge drinking ( more than five drinks per occasion ) , the average weekly number of drinks , and the percentage of adolescents who ever drunk a glass of alcohol and the percentage of adolescents who ever smoked a cigarette or a joint respectively for tobacco and marijuana .
CONCLUSIONS	This study protocol describes the design of a randomized clustered trial that evaluates the effectiveness of a school-based prevention program .
CONCLUSIONS	We expect that significantly fewer adolescents will engage in early or excessive substance use behaviors in the intervention conditions compared to the control condition as a direct result of the intervention .
CONCLUSIONS	We expect that the integral condition will yield most positive results , compared with the e-learning condition and control condition .
BACKGROUND	The protocol for this study is registered with the Nederlands Trial Register NTR@ .

BACKGROUND	Common mental health problems account for up to @ % of all general practitioner ( GP ) consultations .
BACKGROUND	Patients have limited access to evidence-based psychological therapies .
BACKGROUND	Cognitive behavioural therapy self-help strategies offer one potential solution .
OBJECTIVE	To determine differences in clinical outcome , patient satisfaction and costs , between a cognitive behavioural-based self-help package facilitated by practice nurses compared to ordinary care by GPs for mild to moderate anxiety and depression .
METHODS	Randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	Seventeen primary healthcare teams .
METHODS	Patients presenting to their GP with mild to moderate anxiety and/or depression were recruited to the study and randomised to receive either a self-help intervention facilitated by practice nurses or ordinary care .
METHODS	The self-help intervention consisted of up to three appointments : two @ week apart and a third @ months later .
METHODS	There were no restrictions on ordinary care .
RESULTS	Intention-to-treat analysis showed that patients treated with practice nurse-supported cognitive behavioural therapy self-help attained similar clinical outcomes for similar costs and were more satisfied than patients treated by GPs with ordinary care .
RESULTS	On-treatment analysis showed patients receiving the facilitated cognitive behavioural therapy self-help were more likely to be below clinical threshold at @ month compared to the ordinary care group ( odds ratio [ OR ] = @ , @ % confidence interval [ CI ] = @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	This difference was less well marked at @ months ( OR = @ , @ % CI = @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Facilitated cognitive behavioural self-help may provide a short-term cost-effective clinical benefit for patients with mild to moderate anxiety and depression .
CONCLUSIONS	This has the potential to help primary care provide a choice of effective psychological as well as pharmacological treatments for mental health problems .

BACKGROUND	Succinylated human serum albumin ( Suc-HAS ) is a negatively charged neo-glycoprotein that binds to the positively charged V@-loop of HIV-@ gp@ , acting as HIV-@-fusion inhibitor in vitro ( IC@ : @-@ @ microg/ml ) .
BACKGROUND	Suc-HSA was safe in rats and monkeys , and showed antiretroviral effect in a human-to-mouse model .
BACKGROUND	We evaluated safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of Suc-HSA in HIV-@-infected individuals .
METHODS	First , six untreated , chronically HIV-@-infected patients were randomized to a single dose of @ or @ mg/kg Suc-HSA intravenously .
METHODS	Second , five consecutive daily doses ( @ mg/kg , based on the results of the single dose study ) were given to four patients .
METHODS	Safety laboratory assessments , Suc-HSA plasma levels , plasma HIV-@ RNA ( pVL ) , and CD@ + T-cell counts were determined .
RESULTS	Increase of liver transaminases ( grade @/@ ) occurred in one of six patients in the single-dose phase and in three of four patients in the multiple-dosing phase .
RESULTS	Suc-HSA plasma levels were undetectable @ h after a single dose of @ mg/kg .
RESULTS	After a dose of @ mg/kg , plasma levels were more sustained , but declined under the target plasma concentration ( @ microg/ml ) @-@ h post-dosing .
RESULTS	After multiple dosing , plasma levels reached peak values @h post-dosing as predicted by our kinetic model .
RESULTS	However , trough levels were below the target concentrations .
RESULTS	There was no change in pVL or CD@ + T-cell count in either the single - or multiple-dosing phase .
CONCLUSIONS	At the chosen dosing regimens , adequate antiviral plasma levels were not maintained , probably because the hepatic clearance was more rapid than expected .
CONCLUSIONS	This may partially explain the lack of effect on pVL and CD@ + T-cell count .
CONCLUSIONS	The observed liver transaminase increases prohibit further dose escalation .

BACKGROUND	We assessed response rates and compliance for a printed questionnaire and a Web questionnaire in a Swedish population-based study and explored the influence of adding personalized feedback to the Web questionnaire .
METHODS	We assigned @ subjects to @ of @ groups : printed questionnaire , plain Web questionnaire , or Web questionnaire with personalized feedback .
METHODS	The questionnaire had @ parts , first a general section and then a dietary section .
RESULTS	The response rate for the general section was @ % for the printed questionnaire , compared with @ % for the Web questionnaire with feedback .
RESULTS	For the dietary questionnaire , the rates were reversed , resulting in a total response rate for the dietary questionnaire that did not differ between printed and web questionnaire with feedback .
CONCLUSIONS	Interactivity in the Web questionnaire increased compliance in completion of the second section of the questionnaire .
CONCLUSIONS	Web questionnaires can be useful for research purposes in settings in which Internet access is high .

BACKGROUND	Rye bread benefits glucose metabolism .
BACKGROUND	It is unknown whether the same effect is achieved by rye bran-enriched wheat bread .
BACKGROUND	We tested whether white wheat bread enriched with bioprocessed rye bran ( BRB+WW ) and sourdough wholegrain rye bread ( WGR ) have similar effects on glucose metabolism and plasma level of short chain fatty acids ( SCFAs ) .
METHODS	Twenty-one ( @ women ) of @ recruited subjects completed an intervention with a four-week run-in and two four-week test periods in cross-over design .
METHODS	White wheat bread ( WW ; @ % fibre ) was consumed during the run-in , and WGR and BRB+WW ( @ % fibre ) during the test periods .
METHODS	A meal test providing @/@/@ E % from carbohydrates/fat/protein was conducted at the end of each period .
METHODS	Fasting and postprandial plasma samples were analysed for glucose , insulin , and SCFA .
RESULTS	Glucose and insulin responses and plasma concentrations of SCFAs to the meal test were similar between the WGR and BRB+WW periods .
RESULTS	When compared to the WW period , postprandial insulin concentration at @ min was lower ( p = @ ) and the first-phase insulin secretion improved ( p = @ ) only after the WGR period , whereas postprandial concentrations of butyrate ( p < @ ) and propionate ( p = @ ) at @ min increased during both rye bread periods .
CONCLUSIONS	Beneficial effects of WGR over white wheat bread on glucose and SCFA production were confirmed .
CONCLUSIONS	The enrichment of the white wheat bread with bioprocessed rye bran ( BRB+WW ) yielded similar but not as pronounced effects than WGR when compared to WW alone .
CONCLUSIONS	Postprandially measured glucose metabolism and concentrations of SCFAs provided additional information along with fasting measurements .

BACKGROUND	Allogeneic blood transfusion is associated with an increased frequency of postoperative infection .
BACKGROUND	We studied whether such events can be avoided by the intraoperative and postoperative use of leucocyte-depleted blood .
METHODS	@ consecutive patients scheduled for elective colorectal surgery were randomised to receive buffy-coat poor ( n = @ ) or filtered leucocyte-depleted red-cells ( n = @ ) when transfusion was indicated .
METHODS	@ patients actually received blood transfusion .
METHODS	Three patients were excluded from analysis .
RESULTS	The @ patients randomised to and transfused with buffy-coat-poor blood had a significantly higher frequency of wound infections and intra-abdominal abscesses than the @ patients who were allocated to this group but who were not transfused .
RESULTS	( @ vs @ % , p < @ ) and ( @ vs @ % , p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Those receiving buffy-coat-poor blood also had a significantly higher frequency of wound infections and intra-abdominal abscesses than the @ randomised to and receiving leucocyte-depleted blood ( @ vs @ % , p < @ ) and ( @ vs @ % , p = @ ) , respectively .
RESULTS	Postoperative pneumonia occurred at a significantly higher rate in patients receiving buffy-coat-poor blood : @ versus @ % in non-transfused patients ( p < @ ) , and @ versus @ % in patients transfused with leucocyte-depleted blood ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The mortality rate between the groups was not statistically different .
CONCLUSIONS	Our data suggests that the association between allogeneic blood transfusion and postoperative infection is limited to allogeneic blood products that are not adequately depleted of immunosuppressive leucocytes .
CONCLUSIONS	This undesirable effect can be reduced by leucocyte depletion with high-efficiency filters .

BACKGROUND	The value of cord blood IgE in predicting the development of asthma and other IgE-mediated allergic diseases is unclear .
OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this study is twofold : ( @ ) to determine factors affecting cord blood IgE level and ( @ ) to determine whether cord blood IgE predicts the development of asthma and other IgE-mediated allergic diseases in high risk ( defined as those with at least one first degree relative with asthma or @ first degree relatives with other IgE-mediated allergic diseases ) infants at @ months .
METHODS	The study utilized cord blood obtained from a group of high risk infants who took part in a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of an intervention program in the primary prevention of asthma and other IgE-mediated allergic diseases .
METHODS	Total IgE and cotinine in the cord blood were measured .
METHODS	Assessment of the infants was done at @ months for these diseases .
RESULTS	Sixty-four ( @ % ) infants had detectable total IgE in cord blood > @ kU/L .
RESULTS	The proportion of infants with elevated cord blood IgE was significantly higher among nonwhites , birth during winter months , and those with a maternal history of asthma .
RESULTS	There was no correlation between cord blood IgE and cord blood cotinine level .
RESULTS	Cord blood IgE was found to be a significant predictor for the development of urticaria due to food allergy but not for other outcomes .
CONCLUSIONS	Both genetic and environmental risk factors play a role in determining the level of IgE in cord blood .
CONCLUSIONS	Cord blood IgE was a significant risk factor for the development of urticaria due to food allergy at @ months of life .
CONCLUSIONS	As urticaria due to food allergy is a prodrome for anaphylaxis , measurement of IgE in cord blood may be indicated in infants at high risk for developing allergic diseases so that preventive measures can be applied .

BACKGROUND	Terutroban is a selective TP receptor antagonist , i.e. a specific antagonist of the thromboxane A ( @ ) and prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors , shown to improve endothelial function after a single administration in patients with coronary artery disease .
CONCLUSIONS	This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial demonstrates that repeated-dose terutroban for @ days improves endothelial function and inhibits thromboxane A ( @ ) - induced platelet aggregation in high-cardiovascular-risk patients taking @ mg of aspirin per day .
CONCLUSIONS	Terutroban may prove useful for preventing cardiovascular events in such patients .
OBJECTIVE	The specific TP receptor antagonist terutroban improves endothelial function after a single dose in patients with coronary artery disease .
OBJECTIVE	Our aim was to evaluate the effects and dose dependency of repeated-dose terutroban on endothelial function and platelet aggregation in high-cardiovascular-risk patients with carotid atherosclerosis .
METHODS	We randomly allocated @ patients taking @ mg aspirin per day to placebo or to one of three terutroban dosages ( @ , @ or @ mg ) for @ days in a double-blind study .
METHODS	Flow-mediated vasodilatation was evaluated before and @ h after the first oral dose on day @ and @ h after the last oral dose on day @ .
RESULTS	On day @ and day @ , all three terutroban dosages improved flow-mediated vasodilatation and abolished platelet aggregation induced by the TP receptor agonist U@ , without changing the aggregation response to ADP or collagen .
CONCLUSIONS	Terutroban , by chronically improving endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and inhibiting platelet aggregation , may prove useful for preventing cardiovascular events in high-risk patients .

###20739431
OBJECTIVE	We did a randomized phase I/II trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with high-dose melphalan as the conditioning for high-dose therapy and autologous transplant for myeloma .
METHODS	Enrolled patients were limited to those who did not achieve a very good partial remission ( VGPR ) following one or more induction regimens , and were randomized to receive a single escalating dose of bortezomib ( @ , @ , or @ mg/m ( @ ) ) either @ hours before or @ hours after high-dose melphalan .
METHODS	Dose escalation was based on the escalation with overdose control ( EWOC ) , a Bayesian statistical model .
METHODS	Bone marrow aspirates were collected before initiation of therapy and at the time of transplant to evaluate which sequence resulted in maximal plasma cell apoptosis , and response to transplant was assessed by the International Myeloma Working Group criteria .
RESULTS	Among @ randomized patients , @ received bortezomib after melphalan and @ received bortezomib before melphalan .
RESULTS	Toxicities and posttransplant hematopoietic recovery rates were similar between arms .
RESULTS	The overall response rate for all patients was @ % , with @ % achieving a VGPR or better .
RESULTS	Pharmacodynamic studies showed greater plasma cell apoptosis among patients who received bortezomib following melphalan .
CONCLUSIONS	The use of bortezomib in conjunction with high-dose melphalan is safe , with data suggesting improved efficacy .
CONCLUSIONS	A single dose of bortezomib administered after high-dose melphalan is the recommended dose and schedule for future clinical investigation .

BACKGROUND	The advantages of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy ( RARP ) over laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( LRP ) have rarely been investigated in randomised controlled trials .
OBJECTIVE	To compare RARP and LRP in terms of the functional , perioperative , and oncologic outcomes .
OBJECTIVE	The main end point of the study was changes in continence @ mo after surgery .
METHODS	From January @ to January @ , @ patients with organ-confined prostate cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned ( using a randomisation plan ) to one of two groups based on surgical approach : the RARP group and the LRP group .
METHODS	All RARP and LRP interventions were performed with the same technique by the same single surgeon .
METHODS	The demographic , perioperative , and pathologic results , such as the complications and prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) measurements , were recorded and compared .
METHODS	Continence was evaluated at the time of catheter removal and @ h later , and continence and potency were evaluated after @ , @ , @ , and @ mo. .
METHODS	The student t test , Mann-Whitney test , ( @ ) test , Pearson ( @ ) test , and multiple regression analysis were used for statistics .
CONCLUSIONS	The two groups ( RARP : n = @ ; LRP : n = @ ) were comparable in terms of demographic data .
CONCLUSIONS	No differences were recorded in terms of perioperative and pathologic results , complication rate , or PSA measurements .
CONCLUSIONS	The continence rate was higher in the RARP group at every time point : Continence after @ mo was @ % in the RARP group and @ % in the LRP group ( p = @ ) , and after @ yr , the continence rate was @ % and @ % , respectively ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Among preoperative potent patients treated with nerve-sparing techniques , the rate of erection recovery was @ % and @ % , respectively ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The limitations included the small number of patients .
CONCLUSIONS	RARP provided better functional results in terms of the recovery of continence and potency .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to confirm our results .

OBJECTIVE	The study aims to determine if a vaginal examination improves diagnostic accuracy when assessing women who present to the ED with vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy .
METHODS	One hundred and thirty-five women with first trimester bleeding were randomised to have a vaginal examination ( n = @ ) or not ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	They were given a provisional diagnosis , and then a final diagnosis after ultrasound , beta-human chorionic gonadotropin and gynaecological follow up .
METHODS	The provisional diagnosis was considered accurate if it matched the final diagnosis .
RESULTS	The provisional and final diagnoses matched in a little over half of the cases , and there was no statistical difference between the two groups ( ( @ ) = @ , P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	In a stable patient presenting to the ED with first trimester bleeding , clinical diagnosis is highly inaccurate and is not improved by vaginal examination .
CONCLUSIONS	Routine vaginal examination is not necessary as part of the initial patient assessment .

OBJECTIVE	We investigated the association of a polymorphism within the promoter of TauNuF-alpha locus at the position -@ on the likelihood of having acute coronary syndromes ( ACS ) in Greek adults .
METHODS	We studied demographic , lifestyle , and clinical information in @ hospitalized patients ( @ males ) with a first event of an ACS and @ matched by age and sex ( controls ) without any clinical evidence of coronary heart disease .
METHODS	Genotyping was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis .
RESULTS	The genotype frequencies were in patients , @ % ( n = @ ) , @ % ( n = @ ) , and @ % ( n = @ ) for G/G , G/A , and A/A , and in controls , @ % ( n = @ ) , @ % ( n = @ ) , and @ % ( n = @ ) for G/G , G/A , and A/A , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	After adjusting for age and sex , as well as various potential confounders , we observed that G/A or A/A genotypes were associated with @-fold higher odds ( @ % CI @ to @ ) of ACS compared to G/G homozygotes .
RESULTS	No gene to-gender or to-clinical syndrome interactions were observed .
RESULTS	Further subgroup analysis showed that the distribution of TNF-alpha -@ G > A polymorphism was associated with the presence of family history of CHD in patients , but not in controls .
RESULTS	In particular , in G/A and A/A patients @ % reported family history of CHD , whereas in G/G patients , @ % reported family history ( P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Our findings may state a hypothesis of an association between the -@ G > A TNF-alpha polymorphism the development of ACS and the presence of family history of CHD , in Greece .

BACKGROUND	Cerebral injury after Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) is still a serious and unpredictable complication .
BACKGROUND	The S-@beta serum marker has been suggested as potentially useful in the detection of cerebral injury during and after CPB .
BACKGROUND	Direct comparisons of whether laminar or pulsatile pump flow in CABG leads to higher S-@beta values and which type might be more neuroprotective have not been made so far .
METHODS	All @ patients of the study were undergoing CABG for the first time and had no history of cerebral disease in whatever form .
METHODS	They were divided into two groups : laminar ( n = @ ) versus pulsatile ( n = @ ) pump flow .
METHODS	In all cases , a Stckert roller pump ( Fa .
METHODS	Stckert , Munich , Germany ) with a laminar and pulsatile running mode was used for cardiopulmonary bypass .
METHODS	Serum S-@beta levels were detected using a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay ( Sangtec Medical AB , Bromma , Sweden ) .
METHODS	In total , @ different samples were drawn per patient , starting before intubation and ending @ hours after surgery .
RESULTS	S-@beta peak values were found at skin closure .
RESULTS	Median levels were lower in the pulsatile group .
RESULTS	Due to the small study group and wide range , results are non-significant .
CONCLUSIONS	The results indicate that pulsatile flow might have a more neuroprotective effect than laminar flow as S-@beta values were lower .

OBJECTIVE	Evidence that longer-term and exclusive breastfeeding reduces child obesity risk is based on observational studies that are prone to confounding .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate effects of an intervention to promote increased duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding on child adiposity and circulating insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) - I , which regulates growth .
METHODS	Cluster-randomized controlled trial in @ Belarusian maternity hospitals and their affiliated clinics , randomized into @ of @ groups : breastfeeding promotion intervention ( n = @ ) or usual practices ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	Participants were @,@ breastfeeding mother-infant pairs enrolled in @ and @ , of whom @,@ ( @ % ) were followed up between January @ and December @ at a median age of @ years .
METHODS	Breastfeeding promotion intervention modeled on the WHO/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative ( World Health Organization/United Nations Children 's Fund ) .
METHODS	Body mass index ( BMI ) , fat and fat-free mass indices ( FMI and FFMI ) , percent body fat , waist circumference , triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses , overweight and obesity , and whole-blood IGF-I .
METHODS	Primary analysis was based on modified intention-to-treat ( without imputation ) , accounting for clustering within hospitals and clinics .
RESULTS	The experimental intervention substantially increased breastfeeding duration and exclusivity when compared with the control ( @ % vs @ % exclusively breastfed at @ months and @ % vs @ % at @ months ) .
RESULTS	Cluster-adjusted mean differences in outcomes at @ years of age between experimental vs control groups were : @ ( @ % CI , -@ to @ ) for BMI ; @ ( -@ to @ ) for FMI ; @ ( -@ to @ ) for FFMI ; @ % ( -@ % to @ % ) for percent body fat ; @ cm ( -@ to @ ) for waist circumference ; -@ mm ( -@ to @ ) for triceps and -@ mm ( -@ to @ ) for subscapular skinfold thicknesses ; and -@ standard deviations ( -@ to @ ) for IGF-I .
RESULTS	The cluster-adjusted odds ratio for overweight/obesity ( BMI @th vs < @th percentile ) was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) and for obesity ( BMI @th vs < @th percentile ) was @ ( @ % CI , @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	AND RELEVANCE Among healthy term infants in Belarus , an intervention that succeeded in improving the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding did not prevent overweight or obesity , nor did it affect IGF-I levels at age @ years .
CONCLUSIONS	Breastfeeding has many advantages but population strategies to increase the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding are unlikely to curb the obesity epidemic .

BACKGROUND	Nasal packing after routine nasal surgery is commonly practiced in the UK .
BACKGROUND	The most popular pack appears to be Merocel , however this can be associated with significant pain on its removal .
OBJECTIVE	To test the efficacy of a relatively new nasal pack -- the Rapid Rhino Goodman pack -- introduced to our department , which claims to reduce pain and bleeding after nasal surgery .
METHODS	Fourteen patients undergoing routine nasal surgery were recruited into a randomised controlled trial .
METHODS	One nasal cavity was packed with a Merocel pack and the other with a Rapid Rhino Goodman pack .
METHODS	Patients were asked to record pain levels on each side using a visual analogue scale .
RESULTS	We found no difference between packs whilst in-situ , with all patients recording low to moderate pain scores .
RESULTS	There were significantly higher pain levels associated with Merocel pack removal than with Rapid Rhino pack removal ( average pain scores @ vs @ , p < @ ) and less bleeding overall .
CONCLUSIONS	Rapid Rhino ( Goodman pack ) is associated with significantly less pain on removal than Merocel pack , causes less bleeding and is not more painful whilst in-situ .
CONCLUSIONS	We therefore recommend its use in routine nasal surgery .

BACKGROUND	Resiquimod , an investigational immune response modifier and Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) @ and @ agonist , stimulates production of cytokines that promote an antigen-specific T helper type @ ( Th@ ) -- acquired immune response .
BACKGROUND	In animal models , induction of Th@-specific responses modifies experimental herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection .
METHODS	We conducted a randomized , double-blind , vehicle-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of resiquimod @ % gel for reducing human anogenital HSV-@ mucosal reactivation .
METHODS	Adults with genital HSV-@ applied resiquimod or vehicle topically to herpes lesions @ times weekly for @ weeks and then collected daily anogenital swabs for @ days for HSV DNA polymerase chain reaction .
METHODS	Recurrences during the subsequent @ months were treated with study gel .
METHODS	During the final treatment-free @ days , participants again collected daily swabs to assess shedding .
RESULTS	The median lesion and shedding rates were lower for resiquimod compared with vehicle recipients during the initial sampling period ( @ % vs. @ % [ P = @ ] and @ % vs. @ % [ P = @ ] , respectively ) and during the final sampling period ( @ % vs. @ % [ P < @ ] and @ % vs. @ % [ P = @ ] , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Resiquimod did not influence recurrence length .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that the immunological control of HSV-@ reactivation and lesion clearance may differ and that TLR@ and TLR@ agonists can reduce the frequency of mucosal HSV-@ reactivation .

BACKGROUND	Therapies targeting the T cell-mediated pathology of psoriasis have been found to achieve remarkable clinical improvement and have confirmed the crucial role of the immune system either in peripheral blood ( PB ) or in skin .
BACKGROUND	No analyses of T-cell counts in both compartments have been conducted in order to confirm or refute the hypothesized shifts between them .
OBJECTIVE	To gain more insight in the dynamics of compartmentalization of T cells between PB and lesional skin of patients with psoriasis , in response to immune-targeted antipsoriatic therapies .
METHODS	Eighteen patients with psoriasis received either efalizumab ( n = @ ) or etanercept ( n = @ ) for @ weeks .
METHODS	Biopsies were taken for immunohistochemical analysis of T-cell subsets and simultaneously T-cell subsets were isolated from PB specimens by flow cytometry .
RESULTS	The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index declined significantly after @ weeks of etanercept , but not for efalizumab .
RESULTS	After treatment with efalizumab , a significantly decreased number of all T-cell subsets was found in the dermis .
RESULTS	In the epidermis , CD@ + , CD@ + , CD@ + , CD@RO + and CD@ + T-cell subsets were significantly decreased .
RESULTS	With respect to etanercept , few significant changes in T-cell subsets were found .
RESULTS	The percentage of lymphocytes in PB was significantly elevated after efalizumab treatment regardless of responder status .
CONCLUSIONS	Treatment with efalizumab establishes successful recompartmentalization of T-cell subsets with modest clinical efficacy after @ weeks , whereas in etanercept-treated patients , a significant clinical response is no guarantee for significant changes in T-cell subsets in the different compartments .
CONCLUSIONS	Reductions in T-cell subsets can not be used as predictive markers for the clinical response to therapy .
CONCLUSIONS	Interference with the studied T-cell populations in its own right seems not to be responsible for the clinical efficacy of efalizumab and etanercept .

BACKGROUND	In the literature , it is not yet clear whether sex may affect the outcomes of exercise training in obese adults .
OBJECTIVE	The aim of this study was to investigate gender difference in the effects of combined aerobic resistance exercise ( ARE ) versus aerobic exercise ( AE ) alone on body composition in overweight and obese adults .
METHODS	Randomized clinical trial .
METHODS	University-based outpatient clinic .
METHODS	Sixty-five healthy , untrained overweight and obese men and women
METHODS	They were randomized into one of two intervention groups ; AE group ( N. = @ ) performed leg cycle exercises with increasing duration and frequency ; ARE group ( N. = @ ) performed additionally progressive weight-resistance exercises for the upper and lower parts of body .
METHODS	Both groups were asked not to change their diet .
METHODS	Body composition including percentage of fat ( PF ) , fat mass ( FM ) and fat free mass ( FFM ) in regional and whole body was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) at baseline and week @ .
RESULTS	ARE leads to more gains on regional and whole body FFM than AE .
RESULTS	ARE was more effective in increasing the FFM of arms , trunk and whole body and decreasing PF of trunk in men and superior on reducing FM of legs in women when comparing with AE .
CONCLUSIONS	In order to reduce the trunk fat in men and leg fat in women , resistance exercise can be added into an aerobic training program .
CONCLUSIONS	Dissimilar results of exercises on sex obtained in our study serves as a guide for prescribing exercises in overweight and obese men and women .

METHODS	Three similar plaques were randomly allocated to be covered every treatment , covered for @ of @ weekly treatments , and exposed to local UV-B every treatment .
METHODS	Similar plaques were selected in control patients ( awaiting but not yet started UV-B therapy ) .
METHODS	Severity of psoriasis plaques was assessed using a scaling , erythema , and induration ( SEI ) scoring system .
METHODS	Change in SEI score of the selected plaques over the complete treatment course for UV-B-treated patients and change over @ weeks in SEI score of plaques covered during UV-B treatment compared with that of plaques in controls .
RESULTS	There was a significant ( P < @ ) difference in how much the SEI score changed in the @ plaques in UV-B-treated patients .
RESULTS	It fell by a mean of @ for uncovered plaques compared with @ for plaques covered during each UV-B exposure ( @ % confidence interval for difference , @ to @ ) .
RESULTS	In patients awaiting UV-B , SEI score of plaques fell by a mean of @ over @ weeks , compared with a mean fall of @ for covered plaques in UV-B-treated patients ( @ % confidence interval for difference in means , @ to @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	If UV-B therapy has any systemic effect capable of improving psoriasis , this effect is small and unlikely to be of clinical importance .
CONCLUSIONS	It is insufficient to alter interpretation of findings of within-subject comparative phototherapy studies .
CONCLUSIONS	UV-B phototherapy works for chronic plaque psoriasis through local effects .

OBJECTIVE	The purpose of this prospective randomized trial was to examine the effect of tourniquet use on rehabilitation rate , return to work and sport activities , and muscle damage after arthroscopic meniscectomy .
METHODS	Eighty patients who underwent arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were randomly allocated to the use of an inflated ( group A , n = @ ) or deflated ( group B , n = @ ) pneumatic tourniquet .
METHODS	Patients with concomitant ligamentous deficiency or grade III and IV chondral lesions were excluded .
METHODS	The primary outcome measures were pain , measured with a visual analog scale ( VAS ) , and knee range of motion ( ROM ) on days @ and @ postoperatively ; time required for patients to discontinue the use of crutches ; time to return to light activities and moderate sporting activities such as jogging ; and serum creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) levels monitored preoperatively and on days @ , @ , and @ postoperatively .
RESULTS	The @ groups did not differ in terms of age ; male-female ratio ; body mass index ; and preoperative International Knee Documentation Committee , Tegner , and Lysholm scores .
RESULTS	Operative time was not significantly different between groups ( mean , @ for group A and @ for group B ; P = @ ) .
RESULTS	VAS pain scores and knee ROM were not significant between groups ( minimum P = @ ) .
RESULTS	The patients progressed to weight-bearing without crutches within @ and @ days for groups A and B , respectively ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Return to work and jogging did not differ significantly between groups ( minimum P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Serum CPK values were also not significantly different between or within groups during consecutive measurements ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Tourniquet time did not significantly affect postoperative ROM , VAS pain scores , or serum CPK levels ( minimum P = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Tourniquet use for less than @ minutes during arthroscopic meniscectomy does not affect postoperative pain or return to light work and jogging .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , tourniquet-induced muscle damage after arthroscopic meniscectomy , though potentially present locally , is not detectable in the systemic circulation .
METHODS	Level I , prospective randomized trial .

OBJECTIVE	To compare the degree of interstitial fibrosis in renal transplant biopsy specimens from immunosuppressed patients using conventional doses of cyclosporin with and without calcium channel blockade with a combination of low dose cyclosporin and azathioprine ; to correlate the degree of interstitial fibrosis with the glomerular filtration rate .
METHODS	A single blind histomorphometric assessment was done of cortical interstitial volume fraction from biopsy specimens taken intraoperatively and at one , six , and @ months after transplantation from three prospectively randomised groups of patients : ( A ) conventional dose cyclosporin ; ( B ) conventional dose cyclosporin plus nifedipine ; ( C ) low dose cyclosporin plus azathioprine .
RESULTS	Interstitial volume increased with time in all groups .
RESULTS	No differences in interstitial volume were present at operation or at one month , but at six months interstitial volume was significantly less in group B than group A ( p < @ ) or group C ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	More grafts failed in group A than group B leaving only small numbers for comparison at @ months .
RESULTS	At @ months the differences persisted but did not reach significance .
RESULTS	These results strongly reflected the clinical findings , where glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in group A than groups B or C at six and @ months ; no differences in glomerular filtration rate were found at one month .
RESULTS	In a direct comparison glomerular filtration rate showed a significant negative correlation with interstitial volume fraction .
CONCLUSIONS	These findings suggest that calcium channel blockade with nifedipine slows the development of interstitial fibrosis in renal transplant recipients treated with cyclosporin .
CONCLUSIONS	When clinical data are considered , it is suggested that calcium channel blockade may have a mitigating effect on the long term nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporin and should be considered as adjunctive treatment in patients requiring this immunosuppressant following renal transplantation .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate the effects of different frequencies of auricular ( ear-to-ear ) sine-wave transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , administered at subliminal intensity , on trigeminal nerve sensitivity .
METHODS	In a double-blind protocol , healthy volunteer subjects were administered one of three different frequencies of active TENS ( @ , @ , or @,@ Hz ) or placebo TENS ( no current was passed ) for @ min .
METHODS	Department of Psychology , City University of New York .
METHODS	@ healthy undergraduate volunteers with no preexisting pain problems ( @ men and @ women ) , from the Department of Psychology , City University of New York .
METHODS	Pretreatment to posttreatment changes were measured in sensation threshold for a @-Hz electrical stimulus applied transcutaneously to an area @ cm anterior to the tragus of the ear ( mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve ) .
RESULTS	Analysis of variance indicated no group differences in baseline trigeminal sensation threshold , but there were significant group differences in pretreatment to posttreatment changes in sensation threshold ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A postiori analysis showed significant increases in trigeminal sensation threshold after active TENS as compared to placebo TENS ( p < @ ) , with @ - and @-Hz TENS producing significantly greater hypesthesia than @,@-Hz TENS ( p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Sine-wave auricular TENS produces frequency-dependent trigeminal hypesthesia that is not a placebo effect .

OBJECTIVE	Clinical trials have demonstrated that high dose radiation therapy and daily cisplatin ( CDDP ) could increase local control and survival in carcinoma from various sites .
OBJECTIVE	The present phase I-II study has combined high dose radiation therapy and daily CDDP at escalating dosages .
METHODS	From August @ to December @ , @ patients with non-resectable carcinoma of the pancreas were enrolled in a phase I-II multicentric , pilot study to test the toxicity and the effectiveness of high dose radiotherapy and daily cisplatin ( CDDP ) at escalating dosages .
METHODS	A dose of @ mg/sqm/day of CDDP was selected for the phase II step since no grade IV toxicity occurred in any patient in the phase I step .
RESULTS	Toxicity was considered fairly acceptable .
RESULTS	At the time of analysis , the @ patients who entered the study had clear evidence of evolutive disease either locally or distantly in the liver .
RESULTS	It is suggested that high dose radiotherapy ( @ Gy continuously ) and daily CDDP have little effect on local control of the tumor and survival , and only a moderate effect on pain .
CONCLUSIONS	In unresectable , apparently non-metastatic cancers of the pancreas , there is an urgent need for new agents or new combinations of agents to be tested .

BACKGROUND	Crataegus preparations have been used for centuries especially in Europe .
BACKGROUND	To date , no proper data on their efficacy and safety as an add-on-treatment are available .
BACKGROUND	Therefore a large morbidity/mortality trial was performed .
OBJECTIVE	To investigate the efficacy and safety of an add-on treatment with Crataegus extract WS @ in patients with congestive heart failure .
METHODS	In this randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter study , adults with NYHA class II or III CHF and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF < or = @ % ) were included and received @ mg/day WS @ or placebo for @ months .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was time until first cardiac event .
RESULTS	@ patients ( WS @ : @ ; placebo : @ ) were randomised .
RESULTS	Average time to first cardiac event was @ days for WS @ and @ days for placebo ( event rates : @ % and @ % , hazard ratio ( HR ) : @ , @ % CI [ @ ; @ ] ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The trend for cardiac mortality reduction with WS @ ( @ % at month @ ; HR : @ [ @ ; @ ] ) was not statistically significant ( p = @ ) .
RESULTS	In the subgroup with LVEF > or = @ % , WS @ reduced sudden cardiac death by @ % ( HR @ [ @ ; @ ] at month @ ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Adverse events were comparable in both groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In this study , WS @ had no significant effect on the primary endpoint .
CONCLUSIONS	WS @ was safe to use in patients receiving optimal medication for heart failure .
CONCLUSIONS	In addition , the data may indicate that WS @ can potentially reduce the incidence of sudden cardiac death , at least in patients with less compromised left ventricular function .

OBJECTIVE	To assess the corneal swelling response to two myopic correction corneal refractive therapy ( CRT ) lenses of varying Dk/t values , worn for a single night .
OBJECTIVE	Change in thickness of the total cornea , stroma , and epithelium was measured across the horizontal meridian using optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
METHODS	In this double-masked , randomized study , twenty subjects wore a CRT design lens in each eye , manufactured from Menicon Z ( MenZ ; Dk/t = @ ) and Equalens II ( EqII ; Dk/t = @ ) materials .
METHODS	Baseline corneal thickness was measured centrally and at four points either side of the central cornea using OCT , the night before sleeping at the Centre for Contact Lens Research .
METHODS	The next morning , lenses were removed , and thickness measurements were repeated @ , @ , @ , and @ h after removal .
RESULTS	On lens removal , the MenZ eye had central and paracentral corneal swelling ( mean + / - SD ) of @ + / - @ % and @ + / - @ % , and the EqII eye had @ + / - @ % and @ + / - @ % .
RESULTS	These values were significantly different from baseline ( ReANOVA ; p < @ ) and were different between lens materials ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The central epithelium thinned by @ + / - @ % in the MenZ eye and by @ + / - @ % in the EqII eye , with the mid-peripheral epithelium thickening by @ + / - @ % in the MenZ eye and @ + / - @ % in the EqII eye ( all changes different from baseline p < @ ) .
RESULTS	These epithelial values were not statistically different between materials ( p > @ ) .
RESULTS	Stromal swelling values on lens removal were @ + / - @ % centrally and @ + / - @ % mid-peripherally ( MenZ ) and @ + / - @ % centrally and @ + / - @ % mid-peripherally ( EqII ) ( all p < @ from baseline ) .
RESULTS	Central stromal swelling was different between eyes at lens removal ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	Stromal thickness in both eyes returned to baseline values within @ h.
CONCLUSIONS	The higher-Dk/t MenZ material caused significantly less overnight corneal and stromal swelling than the Eqll material , which reinforces the need to prescribe lenses with high Dk/t for overnight wear .
CONCLUSIONS	Neither central epithelial thinning nor paracentral thickening are significantly affected by Dk/t .

OBJECTIVE	Dietary interventions with children often use self-reported data to assess efficacy despite that objective methods rarely support self-report findings in validation studies .
OBJECTIVE	This study compared fourth graders ' self-reported to observed lunch fruit and vegetable intake to determine if the accuracy of self-reported intake varied by treatment condition .
METHODS	Matched randomized follow-up design examined three treatment groups ( high and low intensity interventions and control ) post-intervention .
METHODS	Three hundred seventy-nine middle-school children participating in a randomized controlled trial of a school-based fruit and vegetable intervention were observed during school lunch one day and asked to recall intake the following day .
METHODS	Food items were coded as : `` match , '' `` omission , '' or `` intrusion . ''
METHODS	Students were classified as accurate if all food items matched , otherwise inaccurate .
METHODS	Matched foods ' portions were compared for accuracy .
METHODS	Servings were computed for total fruit and vegetable intake .
METHODS	Accuracy for fruits and vegetables were compared in separate analyses and tested for multiple potential associates : treatment condition , sex , race , body mass index , subsidized meal eligibility , school district , fruit/vegetable availability , age , and test scores .
METHODS	Fitted multivariable regression models included variables found to be significant in univariate or chi ( @ ) analyses .
RESULTS	Variables found to be significant for fruit item accuracy were availability at lunch , body mass index , and subsidized lunch eligibility .
RESULTS	For vegetable item accuracy , availability at lunch was significant .
RESULTS	No differences were found for food portions or for efficacy of the intervention between the two methods of dietary data collection : observation and self-report .
CONCLUSIONS	Condition assignment did not bias recalled fruit and vegetable intakes among fourth graders .

BACKGROUND	Once - and twice-daily low-molecular-weight heparin administered in hospital have been shown to be effective and safe for treating deep-vein thrombosis .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of deep-vein thrombosis treatment using once-daily subcutaneous enoxaparin in the outpatient setting with intravenous unfractionated heparin in hospital .
METHODS	This randomized , parallel-group , open-label study was conducted in @ centers in @ countries .
METHODS	In total , @ patients with symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis who were eligible for home treatment were randomized to treatment with enoxaparin in the outpatient setting ( @ mg/kg subcutaneously once-daily ) or unfractionated heparin in hospital ( @ IU bolus and @ IU/hour intravenous infusion ) for > or = @ days .
METHODS	Clinical endpoints were assessed during a @-month follow-up period .
RESULTS	Among all patients treated with enoxaparin , there was a trend towards fewer recurrent deep-vein thromboses ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) and pulmonary emboli ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) compared with patients treated with unfractionated heparin .
RESULTS	When considering a post-hoc combined endpoint of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism , significantly fewer events occurred in the enoxaparin group than in the unfractionated-heparin group ( @ % vs. @ % ; p = @ ) .
RESULTS	The incidences of bleeding events and adverse events in the enoxaparin and unfractionated-heparin groups were similar .
CONCLUSIONS	Once-daily subcutaneous enoxaparin in the outpatient setting is at least as effective and as well tolerated as in-hospital intravenous unfractionated heparin for treatment of deep-vein thrombosis .

OBJECTIVE	To assess whether complete kangaroo mother care ( KMC ) , a skin-to-skin contact intervention , would affect longitudinal/developmental patterns of hormonal change .
METHODS	An open randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large tertiary care hospital , comparing KMC and traditional care for newborn infants weighing less than @,@ g. Eighty-seven healthy preterm ( < @ weeks gestational age ) infants from this study provided three blood-spot samples on filter paper : at randomization ( postnatal age @-@ days ) , @ weeks later , and at calculated term ( @ weeks gestational age ) .
METHODS	They met a number of additional inclusion criteria including discharge from the hospital within the first postnatal week .
METHODS	The levels of @alpha-hydroxy-progesterone ( @-OHP ) , thyroxine-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) and thyroxine ( T ( @ ) ) were assessed by radioimmunoassay .
METHODS	Birth weight ( < @,@ or > or = @,@ g ) and prenatal maternal corticosteroid treatment were taken into account in the analysis .
METHODS	Complete KMC includes early discharge , positioning the infant on the parent 's chest in an upright position , @ h/day in skin-to-skin contact , and breast-feeding .
METHODS	In the traditional care group , infants were discharged according to routine hospital practice .
RESULTS	Levels of @-OHP and TSH decreased significantly from eligibility to calculated term while T ( @ ) levels did not change significantly over time .
RESULTS	Most importantly , overall , treatment ( KMC ) did not interact with the pattern of physiological change .
CONCLUSIONS	Maturation of the pituitary-thyroid axis and adrenal function is apparently not compromised by KMC , at least in healthy preterm infants .

BACKGROUND	It is well recognized that physical activity ( PA ) is important for older adults ; yet , clinicians remain pessimistic about the ability of older adults with compromised function to adhere to long-term treatment and to maintain behavior change once treatment has been terminated .
METHODS	We examined the functional status of older adults at a field center ( Wake Forest University ) @ years after completing @ months of treatment in the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Pilot study .
METHODS	At baseline , participants were randomized to either a PA or a successful aging ( SA ) control group .
METHODS	Outcome measures included an interview assessment of PA , the Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , and performance on a @-m self-paced walking test .
RESULTS	Two years after the formal intervention had ended , participants who were originally in the PA group continued to engage in more minutes of moderate PA and tended to have better SPPB and walking speed than those in the SA group ( effect sizes [ ES ] : SPPB = @ , walking speed = @ ) .
RESULTS	Seven ( @ % ) participants in the PA group failed the @-m walk at the @-month follow-up assessment , whereas this number was @ ( @ % ) in the SA group .
CONCLUSIONS	Older adults who have compromised physical function are able to sustain some of the benefits derived from participating in structured PA @ years after supervised treatment has been terminated .

BACKGROUND	Male circumcision reduces the transmission of high-risk human papillomavirus ( HPV ) in HIV-uninfected men and their female partners .
BACKGROUND	We assessed whether circumcision of HIV-infected men would reduce the transmission of high-risk HPV to their female partners .
METHODS	Female partners of HIV-infected men ( aged @-@ years ) in Rakai , Uganda , with CD@ counts of greater than @ cells per mL who were randomly assigned to undergo circumcision immediately ( intervention group ) and after @ months ( control group ) were assessed for infection with high-risk HPV .
METHODS	Randomisation was done in blocks of @ , stratified by community , with computer-generated random numbers .
METHODS	Laboratory technicians and female fieldworkers were masked to the circumcision status of male participants .
METHODS	The main outcome assessed in this study was the effects of circumcision of HIV-infected men on transmission of HPV to their female partners .
METHODS	Analysis was by intention to treat .
METHODS	The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT@ .
RESULTS	@ men were assigned to the intervention group , @ to the control group .
RESULTS	@ women were in consensual relationships with @ men in the intervention group , and @ women were in consensual unions with @ men in the control group .
RESULTS	High-risk HPV at the @-year follow-up was prevalent in @ female partners ( @ % ) of @ men in the intervention group and @ ( @ % ) of @ female partners of men in the control group ( prevalence risk ratio @ , @ % CI @-@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	Incidence of high-risk HPV over @ years was @ per @ person-years in the female partners of men in the intervention group and @ per @ person-years in the female partners of men in the control group ( incidence rate ratio @ , @-@ , p = @ ) .
RESULTS	No difference was noted in the clearance of genotype-specific high-risk HPV between the intervention group ( @ [ @ % ] of @ ) and control group ( @ [ @ % ] of @ ; rate ratio @ , @-@ ; p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Because circumcision of HIV-infected men did not affect transmission of high-risk HPV to their female partners , promotion of consistent safe sexual practices for HIV-infected men remains important .

OBJECTIVE	Randomised controlled trials that directly compare cholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease have been characterised by significant methodological limitations .
OBJECTIVE	As a consequence , they have failed to establish whether there are differences between agents in this class .
OBJECTIVE	To help address this question , a double-blind , randomised , controlled , multicentre trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitor treatment in patients with moderate to moderately-severe Alzheimer 's disease over a @-year period .
METHODS	Patients were randomly assigned to rivastigmine @-@ mg/day or donepezil @-@ mg/day .
METHODS	Efficacy measures comprised assessments of cognition , activities of daily living , global functioning and behavioural symptoms .
METHODS	Safety and tolerability assessments included adverse events and measurement of vital signs .
RESULTS	In total , @ patients received cholinesterase inhibitor treatment ( rivastigmine , n = @ ; donepezil , n = @ ) , and @ % of patients completed the study .
RESULTS	The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation in both treatment groups was adverse events , primarily gastrointestinal .
RESULTS	Adverse events were more frequent in the rivastigmine group during the titration phase , but similar in the maintenance phase .
RESULTS	Serious adverse events were reported by @ % of rivastigmine - and @ % of donepezil-treated patients , respectively .
RESULTS	Rivastigmine and donepezil had similar effects on measures of cognition and behaviour , but rivastigmine showed a statistically significant advantage on measures of activities of daily living and global functioning in the ITT-LOCF population .
RESULTS	However , this was not maintained in the non-ITT-LOCF populations .
RESULTS	In secondary subgroup analyses , AD patients who had genotypes that encoded for full expression of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme ( BuChE wt/wt ; n = @/@ ) , who were < @ years of age ( n = @/@ ) or who had symptoms suggestive of concomitant Lewy body disease ( n = @/@ ) showed significantly greater benefits from rivastigmine treatment .
CONCLUSIONS	Cholinesterase inhibitor treatment may offer continued therapeutic benefit for up to @ years in patients with moderate AD .
CONCLUSIONS	Although both drugs performed similarly on cognition and behaviour , rivastigmine may provide greater benefit in activities of daily living and global functioning .

OBJECTIVE	The authors evaluated the effects of acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) usage and transfusion of previously frozen apheresis platelets on postoperative hemorrhage , activities of daily living ( ADL ) score , and mortality rate in patients with acute hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage undergoing craniotomy .
METHODS	This was a prospective , double-blind , parallel , randomized controlled trial in patients with acute hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage , who had either not received ASA therapy ( control ) or received ASA therapy .
METHODS	The patients who received ASA therapy were divided according to the results of a platelet aggregation test into ASA-resistant , ASA-semiresponsive , and ASA-sensitive groups .
METHODS	All patients required an emergency craniotomy for hematoma removal after hospitalization .
METHODS	The patients who were sensitive to ASA were randomized to receive one of the following transfusion regimens of previously frozen apheresis platelets : no transfusion , @ therapeutic dose before surgery , or @ therapeutic doses ( @ before surgery and @ after @ hours of hospitalization ) .
METHODS	The postoperative hemorrhage rate and the average postoperative hemorrhage volume were recorded and the ADL scores and mortality rate were measured during a @-month follow-up period .
RESULTS	The rate of postoperative hemorrhage , average postoperative hemorrhage volume , and mortality rate were significantly higher in the ASA-sensitive patients who received ASA therapy compared with patients who did not receive ASA therapy ( all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	The ADL scores were grouped into different grades and the number of cases in the lower grades was higher and the overall scores were poorer in patients who received ASA therapy compared with those who did not ( all p < @ ) .
RESULTS	After transfusion of previously frozen apheresis platelets , the postoperative hemorrhage rate , average postoperative hemorrhage volume , and mortality rate of the ASA-sensitive patients were significantly lowered ( all p < @ ) , and the ADL scores and their classification level were better than those of patients who did not undergo transfusion ( all p < @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Transfusion of previously frozen apheresis platelets reduces the rate of postoperative hemorrhage , average postoperative hemorrhage volume , disability rate , and mortality rate in ASA-sensitive patients with acute hypertensive basal ganglia hemorrhage undergoing craniotomy .

OBJECTIVE	To evaluate tumor cell proliferation in relation to histopathologic regressive changes and failure after radical prostatectomy after a @-month course of neoadjuvant luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) analogue treatment .
METHODS	We evaluated slides from @ radical prostatectomy specimens of the @ patients participating in a randomized trial of a @-month course of neoadjuvant LHRH analogue treatment before radical retropubic prostatectomy ( n = @ ) versus surgery alone ( n = @ ) .
METHODS	The histopathologic regressive changes in the specimens were scored by two pathologists .
METHODS	Sections were stained with the anti-Ki-@ monoclonal antibody MIB-@ .
METHODS	The proliferation index ( PI ) was defined as the proportion of Ki-@-positive cells in a random cell count .
METHODS	The patients were followed up until treatment failure or for a mean of @ months among those without failure .
RESULTS	In the neoadjuvant group , increasing histopathologic regressive changes correlated with a decrease in capsular penetration , positive surgical margins , and tumor cell proliferation but did not correlate with Gleason score in biopsies .
RESULTS	Treatment failure was not related to the histopathologic regressive changes .
RESULTS	In the neoadjuvant treatment group , progression-free survival was longer in the subgroup of patients with tumors with a PI less than @ % compared with those with tumors with a PI greater than @ % ( P = @ ) .
RESULTS	Multivariate analysis of PI and histopathologic and clinical features showed the PI ( P = @ ) and the pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen level ( P = @ ) to be significant prognostic markers of failure in the neoadjuvant group .
CONCLUSIONS	Tumor cell proliferation after @ months of neoadjuvant hormonal treatment is a prognostic marker of failure after radical prostatectomy without correlation to Gleason score or the histopathologic regressive changes resulting from hormonal treatment .

BACKGROUND	While three types of hepatitis A vaccines are available in China , little data are available to compare them in terms of early antibody response .
BACKGROUND	We conducted a trial to compare antibody response at @ , @ and @ days .
METHODS	We randomized primary school children in Gansu and Jilin provinces into four groups to receive either ( @ ) Chinese live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine ( H@ strain ) , ( @ ) domestic inactivated hepatitis A vaccine ( Healive ( ) ) , ( @ ) imported inactivated hepatitis A vaccine ( Havrix ( ) ) or ( @ ) hepatitis B vaccine ( Control group ) .
METHODS	We compared groups at @ , @ and @ days in terms of proportion of sero-conversions ( @ mUI/ml ) , and Geometric Mean Concentration ( GMC ) of antibodies measured with a Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay ( MEIA ) .
METHODS	We compared rates of self-reported adverse events following immunization ( AEFI ) in the first three days .
RESULTS	@ children received the H@ vaccine , @ received Healive ( ) , @ received Havrix ( ) , and @ received hepatitis B vaccine ( no differences across groups in terms of age , sex , weight and height ) .
RESULTS	At seven days , sero-conversion proportions were @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % ( p < @ ) with GMC of @ mIU/ml , @ mIU/ml , @ mIU/ml and @ mIU/ml , respectively for the four groups .
RESULTS	At @ days , sero-conversion proportions were @ % , @ % , @ % and @ % ( p < @ ) with GMC of @ mIU/ml , @ mIU/ml , @ mIU/ml and @ mIU/ml , respectively .
RESULTS	AEFI were benign and did not differ across groups ( p = @ ) .
CONCLUSIONS	While our study was not able to identify differences between Havrix ( ) , Healive ( ) and H@ vaccine in terms of sero-conversion proportion and GMC between seven and @ days , further studies should evaluate non-inferiority or equivalence of the Chinese vaccines , particularly with respect to the GMC concentration for the H@ vaccine since it could affect long-term protection .

BACKGROUND	The wider use of written advance directives is popular but problematic .
BACKGROUND	We have shown previously that acute hospitalization in the era of the Patient Self-Determination Act can facilitate directive discussions and documentation .
BACKGROUND	We investigated whether a simple educational intervention following hospitalization would increase patients ' execution of durable health care proxies .
METHODS	We studied a consecutive series of patients ( n = @ ) recently discharged from the acute care medical service of a community hospital where they had been interviewed about advance directives .
METHODS	The intervention group was randomized to receive an educational brochure and encouragement to execute durable health care proxies .
METHODS	The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group with completed durable health care proxies on file in their primary physicians ' offices .
RESULTS	Overall , only @ ( @ % ) of @ patients had documented proxies , @ of whom ( @ % ) were @ years of age or older , with no difference between the intervention and control groups ( @ [ @ % ] of @ vs nine [ @ % ] of @ , respectively ) .
RESULTS	Subgroup analysis of elderly patients also revealed no intervention effect .
RESULTS	Univariate analysis revealed three significant predictors of patients ' proxy completion : patient age , whether patients had discussed directives in hospital with their physicians , and whether patients ' physicians completed proxies for themselves .
RESULTS	Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that these three variables interact to predict the probability of patients ' executing proxies .
CONCLUSIONS	Simple educational interventions , like those mandated by the Patient Self-Determination Act , are unlikely to increase patients ' completion of durable healthcare proxies .
CONCLUSIONS	Multidimensional interventions that target both elderly patients and their personal physicians should be tested in the future .
CONCLUSIONS	Discussion in hospital about advance directives can be a useful component of such efforts .

OBJECTIVE	Although significant advances have been made in recent years in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , many patients remain symptomatic despite ongoing treatment , underscoring the need for adjunctive new treatments to help improve response .
METHODS	Forty patients with a primary diagnosis of DSM-IV GAD , who continued to experience GAD symptoms despite current anxiolytic treatment of at least @ weeks ' duration , as evidenced by Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety ( HAM-A ) total score > or = @ and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness scale score of moderate or greater , completed a @-week screening phase and were then randomly assigned to @ weeks of double-blind adjunctive treatment with placebo or risperidone at flexible doses of @ to @ mg/day .
METHODS	Patients continued to take their anxiolytics throughout the study .
METHODS	The study was conducted from June @ through March @ .
RESULTS	Adjunctive risperidone was associated with statistically significant improvements in core anxiety symptoms , as demonstrated by greater reductions in HAM-A total scores ( p = @ ) and HAM-A psychic anxiety factor scores ( p = @ ) compared with placebo .
RESULTS	Although change scores on other outcome variables , including response rates , were higher in the risperidone group , differences did not achieve statistical significance .
CONCLUSIONS	Study findings suggest that risperidone at low doses may represent a useful tool in the management of symptomatic GAD patients .

OBJECTIVE	To determine whether CA-@ velocity is a statistically significant predictor of ovarian cancer and develop a classification rule to screen for ovarian cancer .
METHODS	In the ovarian component of the PLCO cancer screening trial , @,@ women aged @-@ had at least two CA-@ screening tests .
METHODS	Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in @ ( @ % ) women .
METHODS	A multiple logistic regression model was developed to evaluate CA-@ velocity and other related covariates as predictors of ovarian cancer .
METHODS	Predictive accuracy was assessed by the concordance index and measures of discrimination and calibration while the fit of the model was assessed by the Hosmer and Lemeshow 's goodness-of-fit ( @ ) test .
RESULTS	CA-@ velocity decreased as the number of CA-@ measurements increased but was unaffected by age at baseline screen and family history of ovarian cancer .
RESULTS	The average velocity ( @ U/ml per month ) of the cancer group was more than @ times the average velocity ( @ U/ml per month ) of the non-cancer group .
CONCLUSIONS	Among six covariates used in the model , CA-@ velocity and time intervals between baseline and second to last screening test and between last two screening tests were statistically significant predictors of ovarian cancer .
CONCLUSIONS	The chance of having ovarian cancer increased as velocity increased , and the chance decreased when the time intervals between baseline and the second to last screening test and between last two screening tests of an individual increased .

OBJECTIVE	Hot flashes are a common problem for which effective and safe treatments are needed .
OBJECTIVE	The current trial was conducted on the basis of preliminary promising data that pregabalin decreased hot flashes .
METHODS	A double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized trial design was used to compare pregabalin at target doses of @ mg twice daily and @ mg twice daily with a placebo .
METHODS	Hot flash frequencies and scores ( frequency times mean severity ) were recorded daily during a baseline week and for six treatment weeks .
METHODS	The primary end point for this study was the change-from-baseline hot flash score during treatment week @ between the @ mg twice daily target pregabalin treatment and placebo .
METHODS	Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests , two-sample t tests , and chi ( @ ) tests were used to compare the primary and secondary hot flash efficacy end points between pregabalin treatments and placebo .
RESULTS	Hot flash score changes available for @ patients during the sixth treatment week compared with a baseline week decreased by @ % , @ % , and @ % in the placebo , and target @ mg twice daily and @ mg twice daily pregabalin arms , respectively ( P = @ and P = @ , comparing respective pregabalin arms to the placebo arm ) .
RESULTS	While some toxicities were significantly more common in the pregabalin arms , being more evident with the higher dose , pregabalin was generally well tolerated by most patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Pregabalin decreases hot flashes and is reasonably well tolerated .
CONCLUSIONS	A target dose of @ mg twice daily is recommended .
CONCLUSIONS	Its effects appear to be roughly comparable to what has been reported with gabapentin and with some newer antidepressants .

BACKGROUND	Shrimp is a frequent cause of severe allergic reactions world-wide .
BACKGROUND	Due to issues such as cross-reactivity , diagnosis of shrimp allergy is still inaccurate , requiring the need for double-blind , placebo-controlled food challenges ( DBPCFC ) .
BACKGROUND	A better understanding of the relationship between laboratory findings and clinical reactivity is needed .
OBJECTIVE	To determine whether sensitization to certain shrimp allergens or recognition of particular IgE epitopes of those allergens are good biomarkers of clinical reactivity to shrimp .
METHODS	Thirty-seven consecutive patients were selected with clinical histories of shrimp allergy .
METHODS	Skin prick test , specific IgE determinations , DBPCFC and immunoblot assays to shrimp extract were performed .
METHODS	IgE binding to synthetic overlapping peptides representing the sequence of the four allergens from the Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ) identified to date ( Lit v@ , Lit v@ , Lit v@ and Lit v@ ) was analysed .
RESULTS	Of @ ( @ % ) patients , @ had a positive challenge to shrimp ( @ children and @ adults ) .
RESULTS	By microarray , patients with positive challenges showed more intense binding to shrimp peptides than those with negative challenges .
RESULTS	Statistically significant differences in terms of the frequency and intensity of IgE binding to some epitopes were observed between the two groups .
RESULTS	Diagnostic efficiency was higher for individual epitopes than for proteins .
RESULTS	Particularly , efficiency was highest for certain Lit v @ and Lit v @ epitopes , followed by Lit v @ and Lit v @ epitopes .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with positive shrimp challenges present in general more intense and diverse epitope recognition to all four shrimp allergens .
CONCLUSIONS	IgE antibodies to these shrimp epitopes could be used as biomarkers for prediction of clinical reactivity in subjects with sensitization to shrimp .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with positive shrimp challenges show more intense sensitization and more diverse epitope recognition .

RESULTS	Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for @ patients ( @ % ) , four of which ( @ % ) were considered to be possibly treatment-related .
RESULTS	Mean weight gain observed during the original study was +@ kg with an absence of further weight gain at the end of the extension study ( +@ kg ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Long-term insulin glargine treatment plus OHAs provides continued glycaemic control and is well tolerated in patients with Type @ diabetes .
CONCLUSIONS	Therefore , insulin glargine appears to be suitable for the long-term management of Type @ diabetes .

BACKGROUND	A double-blind , randomized , parallel-group , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or flutter ( PAF/PAFL ) experiencing @ or more episodes of symptomatic PAF/PAFL during a @-day observation period to determine the dose-response effect and safety of flecainide .
RESULTS	A total of @ patients at @ centers were randomized to receive @ , @ , or @ mg of flecainide or placebo twice daily ( BID ) .
RESULTS	In @ patients ( per protocol set ) , those remaining free from PAF/PAFL after the treatment were @ % on placebo , @ % on @ mg/BID , @ % on @ mg/BID , and @ % on @ mg/BID of flecainide .
RESULTS	As a whole group , a significant linear dose-response ( p < @ ) was observed and a significant difference between placebo and @ mg/BID was observed ( p < @ ) .
RESULTS	A similar dose-response between the present study and Caucasian study was demonstrated .
RESULTS	Although there were @ patients who needed cardioversion or ablation because of frequent episodes of PAF/PAFL ( @ in @ mg/BID , @ in @ mg/BID , and @ in @ mg/BID of flecainide ) , neither death nor ventricular proarrhythmic event was reported .
CONCLUSIONS	This study indicated that flecainide exerted a significant dose-dependent effect on the prevention of symptomatic PAF/PAFL recurrence and showed that there was no inter-ethnic difference in the clinical effect of flecainide in patients with PAF/PAFL .
